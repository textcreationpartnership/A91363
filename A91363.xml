            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Å¿econd thing to be enquired into, is with whom this Covenant was firÅ¿t made.</head>
                  <p>THis Covenant was not made with us, but with ChriÅ¿t for us; God did not immediately make this Covenant with us, we were children of diÅ¿obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and of wrath, who were not capable of any Å¿uch Covenant and conditions, but it was made with ChriÅ¿t for us, that upon the making of his Å¿oul an offering for Å¿in, he would give unto his Å¿eed eternall life, <hi>Zech. 9. 11. As for thee alÅ¿o by the blood of thy Covenant, I have Å¿ent forth thy priÅ¿oners out of the pit wherein is no water: Adam</hi> loÅ¿t his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the foundation of the firÅ¿t Covenant: But the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t the Å¿econd <hi>Adam,</hi> can never be loÅ¿t, it being grounded upon better promiÅ¿es, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant made with ChriÅ¿t, hath theÅ¿e pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es, <hi>Gen. 12. 3. In thee Å¿hall all families of the earth be bleÅ¿Å¿ed, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20. All the promiÅ¿es of God, are Yea and Amen in him; Å¿o then this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170103:26"/>
was made with him actively, as a perÅ¿on that performed all the conditions upon which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es were grounded; but with us paÅ¿Å¿ively, as the PerÅ¿ons to whom the benefits of theÅ¿e promiÅ¿es do belong: if ChriÅ¿t merited nothing for himÅ¿elf, but wholly for the Elect of God, then all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es made to him do belong to them; or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which was made with him as Mediator, doth belong to us, for whom he doth mediate. Now the parties concerned in this Covenant, are firÅ¿t God the Father, and JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t the Mediator, and the Church or body of ChriÅ¿t, for whom he was to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate. Now this Covenant being made with ChriÅ¿t, he as a Surety is bound to perform and Å¿ee perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the duties that God requires of believers; Å¿o he was arreÅ¿ted, and brought to the bar of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice, where he is convicted, adjudged, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned as a Å¿infull tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿or, Å¿o he Å¿uffered the uttermoÅ¿t rigor of the Law, and not one grain of juÅ¿tice abated him, nor a farthing of the debt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him, no nor Å¿o much as one Å¿in unaccounted for or blotted out, till Å¿atisfaction was firÅ¿t made and given.

                  <p>Next let us examine what ChriÅ¿t did perform or promiÅ¿e to perform on his part,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Covenant in a Å¿enÅ¿e may be Å¿aid to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170103:27"/>
made with us at the death of ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the benefits were merited and procured for us: Å¿o this Covenant came to be confirmed by the death of the TeÅ¿tator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17, 18.

And the blood of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Covenant may be Å¿aid to be made with us, when God doth confirm upon us the benefits which are therein promiÅ¿ed, which are many; I will inÅ¿tance but in three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is the matter and bleÅ¿Å¿ing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on Gods part, in theÅ¿e words, <hi>I will be their God, and they Å¿hall be my people, Ier.</hi> 31. 33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this Covenant ChriÅ¿t doth firÅ¿t give us grace imputed, and then grace: inherit all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Covenant, are the fruits and effects of ChriÅ¿ts death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is alÅ¿o the promiÅ¿e that God will work out the manifeÅ¿tation, by which man Å¿hall Å¿ee his intereÅ¿t in this Covenant, and his right and title to all the bleÅ¿Å¿ings thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now if we would yet farther know when this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made with ChriÅ¿t for us, let us weigh that text, <hi>EpheÅ¿. 1. 4. We are choÅ¿en in him, before the foundation of the world.</hi> Now if Election be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world (Å¿ure it is) then alÅ¿o by the Å¿ame ground the Covenant or promiÅ¿e was made before the foundation of the world, for the word doth prove the one as well as the other; theÅ¿e promiÅ¿es were made firÅ¿t to ChriÅ¿t on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, before they are made to us, becauÅ¿e the whole work of our redemption and Å¿alvation, was tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted

               </div>
               <div n="4" type="subsection">
                  <head>The fourth thing to be enquired into is, whether there be any conditions of this Covenant on our part, and if Å¿o, what thoÅ¿e conditions are.</head>
                  <p>WHat this Covenant is, with whom it was made, and when it was made, hath been laid down before: now it follows in order to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether there be any conditions on our part; and for anÅ¿wer unto which, let me give my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Covenant the Lord doth bequeath grace and glory on no other condition, but the death of the TeÅ¿tator, that is, ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us: as the firÅ¿t Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was built upon the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the firÅ¿t <hi>Adam;</hi> So the Å¿econd is built upon the righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the Å¿econd <hi>Adam:</hi> and it will plainly appear in this Covenant of grace, that there is no condition on our part to entitle us to the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of it; it is true, to our head ChriÅ¿t this Covenant was conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, though to us it is free; to him it was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, hence ChriÅ¿t is called the Mediator, WitneÅ¿s and Surety of this new Covenant, and that this Covenant is without conditions on our part, will appear more fully by theÅ¿e enÅ¿uing reaÅ¿ons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. BecauÅ¿e a Covenant of free grace cannot Å¿tand with conditions, for if it had conditions it would not be of grace, for grace is not grace, if it be not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170103:28"/>
every way free, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. and if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiÅ¿e grace is no more grace, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. BecauÅ¿e to give a thing freely and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otinally are contradictions; and to Å¿ay there is conditions as to us, is to ecclipÅ¿e the grace of God, and to open a door for vain man to boaÅ¿t. So that the whole glory of our juÅ¿tific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>tion and Å¿alvation ought to be given to the grace of God, and to the merits of ChriÅ¿t. If either of them did depend, and were obtained by works and conditions performed by us, it would not be of grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. BecauÅ¿e that juÅ¿tification by grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conditions on our part, is the life and Å¿oul of the GoÅ¿pel, <hi>Galatians 1. 6, 7. I marvell that you are moved from him that called you into the grace of ChriÅ¿t, unto another GoÅ¿pel, which is not another, but there be Å¿ome that would pervert the GoÅ¿pel:</hi> how can there be another GoÅ¿pel, and yet not another GoÅ¿pel? FirÅ¿t it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, becauÅ¿e it is not poÅ¿Å¿ible there Å¿hould be two GoÅ¿pels; yet another GoÅ¿pel, becauÅ¿e men did turn it aÅ¿ide in point of juÅ¿tifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

BecauÅ¿e if any qualification or grace in us be a condition, Faith muÅ¿t needs be the condition, or one of the conditions; but if faith Å¿hould be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of grace, then it differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing from the Covenant of works, for it is as hard a thing for a man to believe, as it is to keep the whole Law.</p>
                  <p>Again, Faith cannot be the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

                  <p>It is true, Faith and repentance are means of our enjoying the comforts of the Covenant, but not the conditions flowing out of the nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; for every means is not a condition, though every condition be a means; Å¿o that we are not juÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, as the condition of the Covenant, but organically and inÅ¿trumentall.</p>
                  <p>So that all the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of the new Covenant are called gifts, not conditions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. and theÅ¿e are gifts that are given freely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. we chuÅ¿e him, becauÅ¿e he firÅ¿t chuÅ¿eth us; and we love him, becauÅ¿e he firÅ¿t loveth us: we cannot Å¿ay God is our God, till he doth firÅ¿t Å¿ay, we are his people; we cannot Å¿ay we will run after him, till he doth firÅ¿t draw us; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we bring forth fruit, unleÅ¿s we abide in the Vine; nor purifie our Å¿elves as he is pure, unleÅ¿s we have this hope in us; Å¿o that we may not expect the effects before the cauÅ¿e, nor the light before the Å¿un, or heat before the fire.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Before the Law the promiÅ¿e of grace was, that notwithÅ¿tanding man had thus rebelled againÅ¿t God, yet the Å¿eed of the woman, which was the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t, Å¿hould bruiÅ¿e the head of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. This Å¿ame Covenant in the dayes of ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles is renewed, and the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Covenant more fully opened and cleared, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more perÅ¿ons are renewed, and more graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿towed, being alwaies to endure one and the Å¿ame; hence it is called a new Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31.</p>
                  <p>Now it is the Å¿ame Covenant of grace both in the old and new teÅ¿taments, only the difference Å¿tands thus.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. It is more firm, being confirmed with an oath, and by the death of ChriÅ¿t.</p>

                  <head>The Å¿ixth thing to be enquired into is, whether this Covenant may not be broken, as the firÅ¿t Covenant of works was.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AS this Covenant was not made with us, but with ChriÅ¿t for us, Å¿o it cannot be broken by us; and as it was not made for our good works, Å¿o it cannot be diÅ¿anulled by our Å¿ins, becauÅ¿e the Lord hath founded it upon his own immutable word and promiÅ¿e, which he hath confirmed by an oath; hence it is called an everlaÅ¿ting Covenant, becauÅ¿e his everlaÅ¿ting love cauÅ¿ed him to make it, and becauÅ¿e it ceaÅ¿eth not when we are in glory, for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in glory is promiÅ¿ed in this Covenant.</p>

and Å¿o peace in the Å¿oul doth come by believing: God is the Author and giver of peace, ChriÅ¿t the Prince and promiÅ¿er of peace, the Spirit the worker and Å¿ealer of peace, and the GoÅ¿pel the word and ground of peace, and the MiniÅ¿ters the meÅ¿Å¿engers of peace, and this bleÅ¿Å¿ed Covenant is Å¿ometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Covenant of peace: but if thou endeavour to believe and canÅ¿t not, conÅ¿ider, God doth not take men into Covenant becauÅ¿e they believe and are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that they might believe and be holy; in this Covenant he doth promiÅ¿e faith and holineÅ¿s to men, and through it he doth convey it to them, and this Covenant being without conditions, it doth give a man the greateÅ¿t encouragement to believe, and caÅ¿t himÅ¿elf into the arms of ChriÅ¿t, and to put on a Å¿trong confidence of inheriting the precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es; Å¿eeing that in their accompliÅ¿hment, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon works and conditions on our part, let us then do as <hi>Benhadads</hi> Å¿ervants did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 31, 32, 33.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. A man may be Å¿aid to be in this Covenant, when he doth find within this frame of Å¿pirit. Oh that I had more of God, that I were filled with ChriÅ¿t: oh that I had his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s to cover me, his grace to pardon me, his power to Å¿upport me, his wiÅ¿dom to counÅ¿ell me, his loving kindneÅ¿s to refreÅ¿h me, and his happineÅ¿s to crown me.</p>

                  <head>The ninth thing to be conÅ¿idered of, is this, wherein doth the Covenant of grace, and the Covenant of works differ.</head>
                  <p>FOR anÅ¿wer hereunto, conÅ¿ider the vaÅ¿t diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law and the GoÅ¿pel, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law affords not a drop of grace, it beÅ¿tows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing freely: the language of the Law is, do thou and live; if not die; no work no wages; but in the GoÅ¿pel, the yoak of perÅ¿onall obedience is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿lated from believers to their Å¿urety; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them to pay; all that they have to do, is to hunger and feed; their happineÅ¿s is free, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect of themÅ¿elves, though coÅ¿tly to ChriÅ¿t, who by his merits hath purchaÅ¿ed for them whatÅ¿oever they would obtain, and by his Spirit worketh in them whatÅ¿oever he requires.</p>
                  <p>The FirÅ¿t Covenant of works is old, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is new: the firÅ¿t is the Law of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Å¿econd is the Law of the Spirit; the firÅ¿t is a Law of death, the Å¿econd is a Law of life: the firÅ¿t was wounding, the Å¿econd is healing; the firÅ¿t a naturall law, the Å¿econd a Å¿pirituall law; the firÅ¿t a law of types, the Å¿econd a law of Å¿ubÅ¿tance: the firÅ¿t was to be done away, the Å¿econd is to continue; the firÅ¿t a Covenant of earthly bleÅ¿Å¿ings, the Å¿econd a Covenant of Å¿pirituall bleÅ¿Å¿ings: the firÅ¿t was to Å¿tand for a time, the Å¿econd was to Å¿tand for ever.</p>
                  <p>Again, this Covenant of grace doth differ from the Covenant of works in the univerÅ¿ality and large extent of it: the firÅ¿t Covenant requires a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170103:37"/>
in us, the Å¿econd doth give and accept of a righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s which is anothers, and imputed to us.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that Religion for the Å¿ubÅ¿tance thereof, was ever one and the Å¿ame, and unchangeable, as appears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1, 2. And Å¿o the word of God written by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es</hi> and the Prophets, did contain whatÅ¿oeever was needfull for the Å¿alvation of the IÅ¿raelites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 32. <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 26. But the in New TeÅ¿tament our Saviour made known unto his DiÅ¿ciples, the laÅ¿t and full will or Covenant of his heavenly father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. 18. and what they received of him, they faithfully preached unto the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. And the Å¿um of what they preached is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to writing, and left upon record for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 1, 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>The difference between the Covenant of works, and the Covenant of grace, may be reduced to theÅ¿e three heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firÅ¿t was a miniÅ¿tration of the letter, a naked Commandment, carrying with it no aptneÅ¿s, diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, or ability to keep it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It breeds enmity and fear; looking on God as a hard taskmaÅ¿ter, and Å¿o fils the Å¿oul full of terrours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a miniÅ¿tration of death, namely by the curÅ¿e, to them that keep it not.</p>
                  <p>But the Covenant of grace is a miniÅ¿tration of the Spirit, requiring no more then what it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿eth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170103:37"/>
to give. In a word, it is a miniÅ¿tration of the Spirit, of love, freedom, and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and of life; for that it Å¿hews the guilty a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s to Å¿atisfie the Law, and the way to obtain a Pardon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The firÅ¿t Covenant was made altogether upon condition on both Å¿ides; the condition on Gods part was, they Å¿hould live; the condition on mans part was, he muÅ¿t do this: but in this Covenant there is not any condition, I mean in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>True it is, could we juÅ¿tifie the Law by keeping it; the Law would juÅ¿tifie us, in and by that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it. But now the Law is become weak and unable to juÅ¿tifie any man, though powerfull and Å¿trong enough to condemn every man.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the Covenant of works a man is left to Å¿tand by his own Å¿trength; but in the Covenant of Grace, God undertakes to keep us through faith to Å¿alvation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the Covenant of works, Gods higheÅ¿t end is the glorifying of his JuÅ¿tice; and in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, it is to glorifie his grace. The voice of the Covenant of works, is like the firÅ¿t Å¿peech of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art the man;</hi> the voice of the Covenant of grace is like his after-Å¿peech, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy Å¿in:</hi> the voice of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, is, the Å¿oul that Å¿inneth Å¿hall die, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>In the Covenant of grace, he Å¿aith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>As I live Å¿aith the Lord, I deÅ¿ire not the death of a Å¿inner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is help for Å¿uch as break the Covenant

of works, but no help for Å¿uch as make void the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.</p>

               <div n="10" type="subsection">
                  <head>The tenth thing to be enquired into is this, what is Gods oraer and method, that he generally makes us of, to bring his people into the bond of the Covenant, and to beÅ¿tow the bleÅ¿sings of the Covenant upon them.</head>
                  <p>FIrÅ¿t, in the making up of the Covenant between God and us: God is the firÅ¿t with us, he is the firÅ¿t mover, he begins with us, before we begin with him: we Å¿hould never Å¿eek to be in Covenant with him, if he did not firÅ¿t allure us, and draw us, invite us, and intreat us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 37. <hi>I will bring them (Å¿aith the Lord) into the bond of the Covenant:</hi> it is the Lord that brings them, they do not firÅ¿t of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themÅ¿elves.</p>
                  <p>1. God prepares his own way for entring into Covenant with us, and then he finiÅ¿heth the work, and in this preparation he doth theÅ¿e three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He breaks us of our Covenant with hell and death, and makes us Å¿enÅ¿ible of our undone eÅ¿tates, &amp; makes us to Å¿ee that we are without God, without ChriÅ¿t, without hope, that we are not under mercy, that we are not as yet of his people, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He opens to us his mind and will, Å¿hewing himÅ¿elf willing to receive us to grace, and to enter into a new Covenant with us, yet again to take us to be his people, and he to be our God: and Å¿o he goes into the Å¿treets, and open places, as it is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20, 21. and there makes publike procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: ho, every one that will, come ye to me,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170103:38"/>
and I will make an everlaÅ¿ting Covenant with you, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 55. 3. <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 65. 1. and if we come not at this firÅ¿t invitation, then he comes and beÅ¿eecheth us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. and Å¿peaks to us as pittying us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12. and lamenting over us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. and all this he doth to perÅ¿wade us to come and Å¿trike a Covenant with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the hearing of theÅ¿e promiÅ¿es and offers of grace, the Lord uÅ¿ually Å¿cattereth Å¿ome little Å¿eeds of faith in the hearts of thoÅ¿e that he will bring unto himÅ¿elf; which Å¿eeds being Å¿own, do quickly put forth, and act towards the Covenant, before by the Father tendred, and layes hold of it, as we Å¿ee in <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Jaylor, <hi>Zacheus, &amp;c.</hi> So by an act of faith, we come to cloÅ¿e with the Covenant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and offered freely unto us, by accepting the grace offered, reÅ¿ting upon God for all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which he hath promiÅ¿ed; and then taking God to be a God over us, Å¿ubmitting to his government and authority, to command us, and to rule us in all things according to his own will; theÅ¿e two things faith doth, and Å¿o takes hold of the Covenant more firmly, in the Å¿ame way and order as God offers it. FirÅ¿t God makes himÅ¿elf known to us as a God of mercy, gracious, long Å¿uffering, pardoning iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion and Å¿in, and Å¿o offers himÅ¿elf to be reconciled to us, though we have rebelled againÅ¿t him, promiÅ¿ing to be a Father unto us, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of us in his beloved, as his Å¿ons and daughters: and thus is the Covenant made up between God and us; and the Å¿oul now begins to Å¿ay in it Å¿elf, I that was an enemy, he hath now reconciled unto himÅ¿elf; I that was in times paÅ¿t, without God, without ChriÅ¿t,

The Saints are Å¿aid to make a Covenant with God, but in <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 103. 18. they are Å¿aid to keep his Covenant; Å¿o there is a making and a keeping of Covenant, and both by Faith.</p>

                  <head>The eleventh thing to be enquired into is, what are the bleÅ¿sings and benefits of this Covenant to us-ward.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> WE can never know the things which are given to us of God, but by knowing of the Covenant, which conveys all the bleÅ¿Å¿ings from God to us. O let us lift up our hearts, to look for great things, great bleÅ¿Å¿ings, Å¿uch as the great God hath promiÅ¿ed; the bleÅ¿Å¿ings are Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our wants, the things of the Covenant are great things, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant is as full of bleÅ¿Å¿ings as of letters, or Å¿yllables, and more; it is a rich Å¿torehouÅ¿e, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed with all manner of gifts and graces, Å¿pirituall and temporall; it is as a tree of life to thoÅ¿e that feed upon it, they Å¿hall live for ever; it is a Well of Å¿alvation, it is a fountain of good things, to Å¿atisfie every thirÅ¿ty Å¿oul, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1. it is a treaÅ¿ure full of goods, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 12. here is unÅ¿earchable riches, unÅ¿peakable mercy, which can never be fathomed, or emptied: all theÅ¿e bleÅ¿Å¿ings of the Covenant are wrapped up in the promiÅ¿es of it, every promiÅ¿e of grace containing a bleÅ¿Å¿ing; as every threatning of the Law contains a curÅ¿e. Now the promiÅ¿es and bleÅ¿Å¿ings of the Covenant are of two Å¿orts: FirÅ¿t, of things Å¿pirituall and eternall. Secondly, of things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; the Å¿pirituall bleÅ¿Å¿ings of the Covenant are cheifly comprehended in theÅ¿e places of Scripture, <hi>Jer. 31. 31, 33.

               <head>Of JuÅ¿tification by Grace.</head>
               <p>THE queÅ¿tion is not Å¿o much about the time, and terms, and matter of our JuÅ¿tification, but how we are made righteous in the Å¿ight of God, which the Scriptures do affirm, to be by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t alone, which God doth impute to all his Å¿eed freely, without works and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions performed by us.</p>
               <p>1. ConÅ¿ider if the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s by which we are juÅ¿tified, be a perfect righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, then we are not juÅ¿tified by our obedience to GoÅ¿pel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, but the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s whereby we are juÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is a perfect righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t alone, <hi>Heb. 1. 8. Mat. 6. 33. Rom. 4. 6. and everlaÅ¿ting righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, PÅ¿al. 119. 142. PÅ¿al. 22. 31. &amp;</hi> 35. 28. that righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s which juÅ¿tifieth us before God, as it is not ours, Å¿o it is not in us.</p>
               <p>But as it is ChriÅ¿ts righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, Å¿o it is in him, <hi>In me you Å¿hall have righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s and Å¿trength, PÅ¿al. 71. 15, 16, 19, 24. I will make mention of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s, even of thine only.</hi> JuÅ¿tice and mercy do both meet in this JuÅ¿tification; JuÅ¿tice, in that he will not juÅ¿tifie a Å¿inner, without a perfect righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s; and yet mercy, in that he will accept him for Å¿uch a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿neÅ¿s, that is, neither in him, nor done by him, but by his Å¿urety for him.</p>
               <p>2. ConÅ¿ider the ApoÅ¿tles all along were very carefullto keep this Doctrine of JuÅ¿tification by grace diÅ¿tinct from all other things, they all along do oppoÅ¿e the Law and grace, works and faith,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170103:42"/>
our righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s and ChriÅ¿ts righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us thereby how needfull it is they Å¿hould be kept aÅ¿under.</p>
               <p>JuÅ¿tification by grace hath been and will be the bone of contention till the next coming of ChriÅ¿t: why Å¿o? becauÅ¿e learning cannot reach it, naturall wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is confounded at it, evill Angels do not know it, moÅ¿t men do perÅ¿ecute it, as being bereaved of the knowledge of it, or elÅ¿e corrupt in the Å¿impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of it.</p>
               <p>The PapiÅ¿ts Å¿ay, if we be freely juÅ¿tified by grace, we need not do any good works, and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall from grace, we need not fear to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Å¿in.</p>
               <p>And they hold that we are not juÅ¿tified by the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t imputed, but by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t inherent in us, and righteous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done by us.</p>
               <p>3. ConÅ¿ider we Å¿hould not be juÅ¿tified by grace, if any condition were required of us, in order to our juÅ¿tification; for the condition whenÅ¿oever perÅ¿orm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes the Covenant a due debt; then juÅ¿tifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Å¿hould not be of grace, but of debt, contrary to the expreÅ¿s words of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>4. ConÅ¿ider the nature and cauÅ¿e of juÅ¿tification more particularly, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>JuÅ¿tification, is when God meerly of his own grace and free will, forgiveth our Å¿ins, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us juÅ¿t and innocent.</p>
               <p>Though Gods Law was by us violated, we are abÅ¿olved from Å¿in and puniÅ¿hment by the grace of God, and merits of ChriÅ¿t apprehended by faith: and Å¿o by him all that believe are juÅ¿tified in all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170103:43"/>
things, in which they could not be juÅ¿tified by the Law of <hi>MoÅ¿es, Act.</hi> 13. 39. JuÅ¿tification is an act undivided, and all at once, and Å¿o it differs from Å¿anctification, which is done by degrees; all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent eminent acts, as juÅ¿tification, Å¿anctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, renovation, are but one act in God. I Å¿hall cloÅ¿e up what I have to Å¿ay to this thing, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iring the reader Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e precious Scriptures, all Å¿peaking to the Å¿ame thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Now to him that workoth not, but beleiveth on him that juÅ¿tifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Not by works of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s which we have done, but according to his mercy he Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us. Rom.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>And if By grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiÅ¿e grace is no more grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So having Å¿poken to the nature of juÅ¿tification, give me leave alÅ¿o to lay down the uÅ¿efulneÅ¿s of it as to us, and the benefits every beleiver have by it, the greateÅ¿t thing that we can deÅ¿ire (next the glory of God) is our own Å¿alvation, and the Å¿weeteÅ¿t thing we can here obtain, is the aÅ¿Å¿urance of our Å¿alvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In this life we cannot get higher then to be aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ured of that which in the next life is to be enjoyed; all godly people Å¿hall enjoy a Heaven when they leave this earth; Å¿ome enjoy a Heaven whilÅ¿t they are here on earth; that ChriÅ¿tians may enjoy two Heavens, let them enquire after, diligently Å¿eek for, and cheerfully embrace this Doctrine of juÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, freely and only by the grace of God, as the cauÅ¿e, through ChriÅ¿t as the way, the Holy-GhoÅ¿t as the worker and evidencer.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The Å¿econd way of peace, is this, a man muÅ¿t not only know it, where it is, and believe it, but he muÅ¿t Å¿tay himÅ¿elf wholly upon God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant expectation of the increaÅ¿e and Å¿upply of it, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 26. 3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoÅ¿e heart is Å¿tayed on thee.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. The next vein through which peace is conveyed to the Å¿oul, is by our acquainting our Å¿elves with him, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Acquaint now thy Å¿elf with him, and be at peace thereby, Å¿o good Å¿hall come unto thee;</hi> now by thy acquainting thy Å¿elf with him, theÅ¿e things will fall in.

Oh ye Heavens Å¿tand amazed! and oh thou earth, fleÅ¿h and blood rejoyce and triumph, for when there was no eye to pitty thee, the arm of the Lord hath brought Å¿alvation, by raiÅ¿ing up a mighty one out of the houÅ¿e of his Å¿ervant <hi>David,</hi> even ChriÅ¿t the

And all the unÅ¿tability, formality, legality that there is at this day appearing amongÅ¿t the Presbyterian, Independant and BaptiÅ¿t, or any other people profeÅ¿Å¿ing godlineÅ¿s, doth ariÅ¿e from their ignorance or their little knowledge in this great myÅ¿terie; nay farther, did you ever read, or from any true ChriÅ¿tian hear, that any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was acquainted with, and in Å¿ome good meaÅ¿ure eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in (this Doctrine of grace) infected with, and overcome by theÅ¿e floods of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that doth now Å¿warm among us?

Now for a remedy herein, let every ChriÅ¿tian Å¿tudy, pray and enquire for, and Å¿tand in the grace of God: See that bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed place, 1 <hi>Peter 5. 12.

               <p>PapiÅ¿ts and Arminians, which hold a falling away from grace, know not the difference between the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace; their errour is this, they teach as a principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that thoÅ¿e that are adopted, Å¿anctified and planted into ChriÅ¿t may fall away and periÅ¿h; this Doctrine is contrary to the whole tenor of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, injurious unto God, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable unto the Saints: it would Å¿hake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Gods election, if thoÅ¿e that are once Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Å¿hould fall away and periÅ¿h, for thoÅ¿e only whom he knew before, thoÅ¿e only doth he Å¿anctifie; now if he hath in mercy drawn us to himÅ¿elf, it is a Å¿ign he hath loved us from everlaÅ¿ting, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. our calling and Å¿anctification is according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, <hi>Rom. 8. 28, 30. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 9. and thoÅ¿e that are Å¿anctified, juÅ¿tified and called, are all firÅ¿t choÅ¿en, and thence faith is called the Faith of Gods elect, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.

               <p>5. This Doctrine is the main Å¿upport of a Å¿oul under all tryals; when all things fail, Gods grace and free love doth never fail.</p>

               <p>Then when a Å¿oul is thus beweldred and troubled, the Lord many times diÅ¿covers his free grace and love, and that expells ignorance, and Å¿layeth the Å¿ouls enemies, and by this love the Lord draweth

Luther</hi> reports of a <hi>German</hi> MiniÅ¿ter, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged himÅ¿elf, that before he came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand aright the free and powerful grace of God, he vowed and reÅ¿olved above one hundred times againÅ¿t Å¿ome particular Å¿in, and never could get power over it; at laÅ¿t he Å¿aw the reaÅ¿on to be his ignorance in the Doctrine of grace, and his too much truÅ¿ting to his own reÅ¿olution; at laÅ¿t he could reÅ¿iÅ¿t Satan Å¿ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faÅ¿tly in the faith, and he would flie from him, <hi>James</hi> 4. 7. we read in 1 <hi>John 5. 4. This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. This is the Doctrine that Satan doth make war againÅ¿t, either to pervert or corrupt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He Å¿eeks to pervert it by putting out of order, or turning up-Å¿ide-down, to bring in that which Å¿hould be kept out, <hi>Prov. 10. 9. He that perverteth his way Å¿hall be known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If he cannot prevail with men to pervert this Doctrine, he Å¿hall leave no means unattempted, no Å¿tone unturned to corrupt it, by keeping people in a fooliÅ¿h unÅ¿ound perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, that all is well with them, <hi>PÅ¿alm 143. They are all corrupt;</hi> that is, they have not underÅ¿tanding to perceive the things which God offereth to them.</p>
               <p>There be two main things in which Satan doth buÅ¿ie himÅ¿elf to deceive Å¿ouls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By laying the greatneÅ¿s and vileneÅ¿s of a mans Å¿ins before him, and then falls to perÅ¿wade
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170103:50"/>
him there is no mercy in God for Å¿uch a Å¿inner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By preÅ¿enting God to the Å¿oul as one made up all of mercy.</p>
               <p>1. By laying the greatneÅ¿s and vileneÅ¿s of ones Å¿ins before him, and then perÅ¿wades him, there is no mercy in God for Å¿uch a Å¿inner: What Å¿aith Satan, doÅ¿t thou think that ever thou Å¿halt attain mercy by ChriÅ¿t, that haÅ¿t Å¿inned with Å¿o high an hand in Å¿light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tenders of grace, and grieved the Spirit of grace, and deÅ¿piÅ¿ed the Word of grace, that haÅ¿t trampled under foot the blood of ChriÅ¿t, by which thou mighteÅ¿t have been pardoned, purged, juÅ¿tified and Å¿aved? What doÅ¿t thou think, Å¿aith Satan, that ever ChriÅ¿t will own, receive or embrace Å¿uch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy wretch as thou art? Thou art unworthy to entertain ChriÅ¿t in thy houÅ¿e, much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to entertain him in thy heart; thou fool, thou knoweÅ¿t thou art not prepared, thou art not thus and thus humbled, thou art not heart Å¿ick of Å¿in, thou haÅ¿t not been under horrors and terrors, as Å¿uch a man and Å¿uch a woman, thou muÅ¿t Å¿tay till thou art prepared, and qualified to receive ChriÅ¿t; for albeit ChriÅ¿t is able, yet he is not willing to Å¿ave Å¿uch a rebell as thou art, that haÅ¿t been in open Rebellion againÅ¿t him all thy daies: now for anÅ¿wer hereunto.</p>
               <p>That there is mercy for Å¿uch miÅ¿erable creatures, if they will receive it, and not diÅ¿pair, will more at large appear in theÅ¿e choice places of Scripture, <hi>Micah 7. 18, 19. IÅ¿a. 43. 25. Jer. 3. 12. Joel 2. 13. IÅ¿a. 55. 7. 1 Tim. 1. 13, 15. PÅ¿alm 66. 18. Iohn 6. 37. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. Heb. 7. 25. IÅ¿a.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:170103:51"/>It is hard to find any one place in the whole Book of God, requiring any worthineÅ¿s in the creature, before a Å¿ouls believing in ChriÅ¿t, and reÅ¿ting upon him for happineÅ¿s and bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿s; I read of none that obtained mercy and pardon from ChriÅ¿t but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Å¿ouls; pray what worthineÅ¿s was in <hi>Zachens, Mary Magdalen, Paul</hi> and <hi>Lydia</hi> before their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and believing in ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>2. If Satan cannot catch men in this firÅ¿t pit, then he turns over leaf and comes a new way to work, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                  </hi> by preÅ¿enting God to the Å¿oul as one made up all of mercy; Oh Å¿aith Satan, you need not make Å¿uch a matter of Å¿in, nor to be Å¿o unwilling to Å¿in, for God is a God of mercy, a God that delighteth in mercy, ready to Å¿hew mecry, a God that is never weary of Å¿hewing mercy, he is a God more prone to pardon his people, then to puniÅ¿h them, and why then Å¿hould you make Å¿uch a matter of Å¿in? by this Satan doth cauÅ¿e many a Å¿oul to turn the grace of God into wantonneÅ¿s; but for a remedy herein, conÅ¿ider that God is as juÅ¿t as he is merciful, as the Scripture doth Å¿peak him out to be, a very merciful God, Å¿o they Å¿peak him forth to be a very juÅ¿t God, witneÅ¿s his caÅ¿ting the Angels out of heaven, his turning Father <hi>Adam</hi> out of ParadiÅ¿e, his drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old world, his raining fire out of heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sodom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, his general mercy is over all his works, but his Å¿pecial mercy is confined to thoÅ¿e that he hath divinely qualified, <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7. PÅ¿al. 32. 10. PÅ¿al.</hi> 103. 11.</p>
               <p>8. This Doctrine is the moÅ¿t hardeÅ¿t thing in the world to be learned, it being wholly in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170103:51"/>
every part of it Å¿upernatural, and all things in us do fight againÅ¿t it.</p>
               <p>To do well and have well is natural, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and have well is Å¿upernatural; man remaining in his natural Å¿tate, is altogether unable to receive and comprehend thoÅ¿e glorious and gracious myÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of being righteous by anothers righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and of being Å¿aved by anothers Å¿uffering; all men both Jews and Gentiles are Å¿et upon Å¿eeking life and happineÅ¿s by their own doings and performances; for although man did fearfully fall by tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion, yet he retained certain foot-Å¿teps, marks and impreÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of that moral and eternal Law of righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, which was at firÅ¿t engraven in his heart, by the finger of God Almighty. So that although as to everlaÅ¿ting felicity man is dark and dead, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the God of this world, whoÅ¿e Kingdom is a Kingdom of darkneÅ¿s, who rules in men by ignorance, yet there remains in every man Å¿o much light as doth lead him to the knowledge of a God; but when the Lord doth reveal this myÅ¿terie of his grace by his Spirit to and in man, then he doth over and above that common work of the Spirit, by which he enlighteneth every man; I Å¿ay, ChriÅ¿t doth give unto thoÅ¿e given him of the Father, the mind and underÅ¿tanding to know him and to receive him, and to lay hold on him, for life and Å¿alvation. Now in this Å¿enÅ¿e the natural man perceiveth not the things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. neither can he know them, becauÅ¿e they are Å¿piritually diÅ¿cerned, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 21. The world by wiÅ¿dom knoweth not God,</hi> &amp;c. Now this Doctrine of grace is the hardeÅ¿t thing in the world to be learned, becauÅ¿e we are naturally apt to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170103:52"/>
hunger and thirÅ¿t after a righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of our own, but it muÅ¿t be renounced; I confeÅ¿s this Å¿elf denyal is very hard: Oh how hard is it for the Å¿oul to be taken off its own bottom of works and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to Å¿trip them of all that is their own! ye take away their lives, they muÅ¿t and will have Å¿omething; Å¿ome humbleneÅ¿s and brokenneÅ¿s of heart, Å¿ome tears, Å¿ome good works or abilities, or good heart, as many Å¿ay; and this doth argue as yet thou art not pluckt off thine own Å¿tock, and therefore art not planted into ChriÅ¿t; thou art igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of God, and Å¿o goeÅ¿t about to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h thine own righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s; conÅ¿ider, conÅ¿ider our works make us not the better before God, neither the more beloved of the Lord, but declare us to be what we are made by God, and Å¿o are profitable to men, but not to God.</p>
               <p>But what Å¿aith the Scripture? now to him that worketh is not the reward reckoned of grace but of debt; but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juÅ¿tifieth the ungodly, his faith is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>We are Å¿aved, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoÅ¿e and grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Again, we read, <hi>Rom. 5. 10. When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> IÅ¿a. 43. 25. <hi>I will blot out thy tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ions for mine own Å¿ake, and will not remember thy Å¿ins; a new heart alÅ¿o will I give thee,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26, 27, 31. Again, <hi>IÅ¿a. 57. 18. I have Å¿een his waies and will heal him,</hi> IÅ¿a. 44. 22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿sions, return to me, for I have redeemed thee,</hi> Ezek. 16. 6, 8. <hi>When thou waÅ¿t polluted in thy own
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170103:52"/>
blood, I Å¿aid unto thee live; when thou waÅ¿t in thy blood, thy time was the time of love: and I covered thy nakedneÅ¿s.</hi> Now conÅ¿ider the Lord doth this that he might have all the glory of our Election, Vocation, JuÅ¿tification, Sanctification and Salvation. See <hi>Eph. 1. 6. Jer. 9. 24. Rom. 3. 9. Luke 1. 74. 1 Cor. 4. 7. Iames</hi> 1. 17. And as this Doctrine is the hardeÅ¿t thing in the whole world to be learned, Å¿o it is the hardeÅ¿t work (where it is not learned) to obey God in any of his commands; to inÅ¿tance in one for all, God doth command men every where to repent: but is not repentance a mighty work, a difficult work, a work that is above our power? Surely there is no power below that power that raiÅ¿ed ChriÅ¿t from the dead, and that made the world, that can break the heart of a Å¿inner, or turn his heart. It is as eaÅ¿ie to turn the Å¿tream that runs Å¿wiftly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and make it run as Å¿wiftly backward, as it is to repent indeed, and to melt thine own heart; it is as eaÅ¿ie to turn a flint into fleÅ¿h, as to turn thine own heart to the Lord; it is as eaÅ¿ie to raiÅ¿e the dead, and make a world, as to repent; it is a flower that grows not in natures Garden, <hi>Jer. 13. 23. Can the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian change his skin, or the Leopard his Å¿pots? then may ye alÅ¿o do good, that are accuÅ¿tomed to do evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this work that is Å¿o difficult, and Å¿o hard, above our reach, is eaÅ¿ily wrought in the Å¿oul, when God gives it to Å¿ee his grace and love in giving ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Act. 5. 31. Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to IÅ¿rael, and forgiveneÅ¿s of Å¿ins,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. If I or any other, or an Angel of heaven preach any
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170103:53"/>
other GoÅ¿pel then this, that we have preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, then Å¿alvation and participation of ChriÅ¿t by grace, and free gift, for that is the Doctrine he had eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed, before and through the whole EpiÅ¿tle to the <hi>Galathians:</hi> What Å¿hall I Å¿ay more? there is nothing in men, though never Å¿o vile, that can debar a perÅ¿on or a people from a part in this ChriÅ¿t; Å¿ome will not have ChriÅ¿t except they can pay for him, others dare not meddle with ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e they are Å¿o vile and Å¿inful, and therefore they Å¿eek to get an inherent righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, they run to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, to their prayers, to their tears, to their humiliations, and Å¿orrows, and reformations, and will not come at ChriÅ¿t untill they have Å¿pent all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theÅ¿e PhyÅ¿itians, and are Å¿enÅ¿ible with the woman in the GoÅ¿pel, that they are nothing the better, but the worÅ¿e; then they begin to think of the back parts of ChriÅ¿t, and wait for a time to come behind him in a throng, that they may not be Å¿een to touch the hem of his garment.</p>
               <p>You know when a pump is drie, men uÅ¿e to fetch a Bucket of water, and pour it into the dry pump, and then they fall to pumping, and by vertue of the water poured in, there comes more water up, and by continual pumping they fetch out abundance: So our hearts many times are dry, there is no Å¿ap, no moiÅ¿ture, no life: the vertues of ChriÅ¿t muÅ¿t firÅ¿t be poured in, before you can get any thing out. Wherefore Å¿tand we labouring and tugging in vain? O Å¿tay no longer, go to ChriÅ¿t, it is he that muÅ¿t break thy rocky heart: in a word, we muÅ¿t conÅ¿ider ChriÅ¿t as freely given us by the Father, before we can believe the life of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170103:53"/>This Doctrine Å¿peaks out with open mouth the exceeding freeneÅ¿s and riches of Gods grace, as will appear, if we conÅ¿ider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God is firÅ¿t in Å¿eeking after us, to draw us into Covenant with himÅ¿elf; we Å¿eek not him, but he Å¿eeks us; we chuÅ¿e not him, but he chuÅ¿eth us; we wait not on him, he waits to be gracious to us: we beÅ¿eech not him, he doth beÅ¿eech us to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20.

               <p n="2">2. ConÅ¿ider, the time wherein the Lord doth Å¿eek to us, and take us by the hand, to bring us into Covenant with him, and then we Å¿hall find, that when we are moÅ¿t averÅ¿e and backward, and have leaÅ¿t thought of Å¿eeking after him, then it is that he Å¿eeks us: thus the Lord called <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was perÅ¿ecuting, raging, and breathing out Å¿laughter againÅ¿t the Lord, and againÅ¿t his Saints; then the Lord takes him by the hand, and enters into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and Å¿o it was with thoÅ¿e mockers, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 13, 37. Here were no diÅ¿poÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and preparations on their part, but free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected grace from God.</p>

truly Å¿ay to all, I do thee no wrong, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 13. Thou haÅ¿t as much as I owe thee. So then it muÅ¿t needs be free grace to thoÅ¿e that are taken in: apply <hi>John 14. 21.

The reaÅ¿ons why the Lord would have his Covenant to Å¿tand upon this foundation of free grace are theÅ¿e.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be a ground of hope, to Å¿uch as Å¿ee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves unworthy of acceptance with God, if the grace of the Covenant were not free, Å¿uch unworthy ones could have no hope.</p>

               <p n="4">4. That our mercies and bleÅ¿Å¿ings may be Å¿ure to us, <hi>Rom. 4. 16.

Secondly, Let us be free in doing good unto all men, even to Å¿uch as have deÅ¿erved nothing, though they be aliens and Å¿trangers, and Å¿uch as we never hope to receive any good from, yet freely to do them good, even where we look for nothing again, as God hath done to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 12, 14.</p>
               <p>10. As this Covenant and grace is free, Å¿o it is Å¿ure and certain to be performed, it cannot, it will not fail thoÅ¿e that reÅ¿t upon it.</p>
               <p>The Covenant and promiÅ¿e of grace, are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the unchangable purpoÅ¿e of God, which is a foundation remaining Å¿ure, and cannot be Å¿haken, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.

               <p>So then it is free, and it is Å¿ure, and the freeneÅ¿s of it doth prove the Å¿ureneÅ¿s of it, it is free that it might be Å¿ure; Å¿o here it is Å¿ure becauÅ¿e it is free; nothing can hinder free grace from giving eternal life to whom it will.

A yoak we are commanded to take upon us, but Å¿uch as is made moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ie to bear, becauÅ¿e, that God which layeth it upon us, hath promiÅ¿ed to Å¿trengthen, Å¿upply and Å¿upport us; he who is righteous in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, is gracious in promiÅ¿ing: let us be Å¿trong in believing, and fervent in praying, and our work will be our meat, our duty our delight, and God will let us Å¿ee that he hath either the CaÅ¿tle of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or the Ark of a promiÅ¿e, or the al-Å¿ufficiency of his own grace, for a retirement of his people in the greateÅ¿t Å¿torms and tempeÅ¿ts.</p>

                     <hi>Believe on the Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and thou Å¿halt be Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Now might not the Jaylor have replyed as many do now in our daies, and Å¿ay, I can as well make a world, work miracles, overturn moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as believe by mine own power; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> why bid ye me believe?</p>
                  <p>To this I anÅ¿wer, though it be true, that every commard of God is alike difficult to fleÅ¿h and blood, that a man can indeed as well make a world, as make a prayer aright, a man may as well Å¿ubdue an army of men, as Å¿ubdue one luÅ¿t, did not the Lord convey a power into the Å¿oul, together with the command, <hi>viz.</hi> If God command a man to believe, and gives him power to believe, the work will Å¿oon be done, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. The Lord commands to make a new heart: now a man is no more able to make a new heart, then to make a new world: therefore as we Å¿aid before, he promiÅ¿eth in the Å¿ame place to give a new heart: and in another place it is Å¿aid, mortifie your luÅ¿ts: now this a man cannot do of himÅ¿elf: but the Å¿ame God that commands us to kill our luÅ¿ts, will kill them for us, <hi>Micah 7. 18, 19. He will Å¿ubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caÅ¿t all their Å¿ins into the depth of the Sea.</hi> Again, God commands us to repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>, but we are no more able to repent, or to Å¿hed one tear for Å¿in then a rock is to give out water, or we are no more able to repent, then to turn the Å¿tream, or to make a Å¿lint fleÅ¿h, till the Lord give us a repenting heart: he hath promiÅ¿ed to give repentance to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So that the commands in Scripture, doth not Å¿hew what the creature can do, but what he Å¿hould do, yet not by our own natural power,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170103:62"/>
but by his aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting grace to enable us to do, what of our Å¿elves we cannot do, therefore we Å¿hould pray with Saint <hi>AuguÅ¿tine,</hi> Lord give what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeÅ¿t, and then command what thou pleaÅ¿eÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>To draw towards a concluÅ¿ion to this point, let me acquaint the Reader of what I have obÅ¿erved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t all Å¿orts of men with whom I have more or leÅ¿s converÅ¿ed, <hi>viz.</hi> FirÅ¿t the PapiÅ¿t, both in their writings and diÅ¿courÅ¿es, cry up and preÅ¿s all people to be doing good works. The <hi>Arminian</hi> his coÅ¿en Jerman, pleads for the Å¿ame, and that almoÅ¿t, if not altogether, from the Å¿ame principle, to the Å¿ame end: the new upÅ¿tart Quakers, fals in and cloÅ¿eth with theÅ¿e old errors, preÅ¿Å¿ing people to do the thing that is commanded, but not as it is commanded; Å¿o many of our brethren of the Presbyterian party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and under a Å¿pirit of bondage themÅ¿elves, preach the Law before the GoÅ¿pel, and put their hearers to act for life, but not from life. So alÅ¿o our brethren of the Independant party, and thoÅ¿e of the BaptiÅ¿t party, many of them to my own knowledge do more mind the things they do for God in way of obedience to his commands, then they do the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from which, the rule by which, and the end to which they do it; and when they have done it, even theÅ¿e alÅ¿o are apt to lay too great a Å¿treÅ¿s upon it. So then the PapiÅ¿t, freewiller, Quaker, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Independant, BaptiÅ¿t, all theÅ¿e preach, teach and cry out to all their hearers for a holy converÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay to come a little nearer home, the word of God cals upon us for it, our own conÅ¿ciences call for it, and check us for our remiÅ¿sneÅ¿s therein; nay the ChriÅ¿tians with whom we converÅ¿e expect it from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170103:63"/>
us, what remains then but that we be found in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of it, but let us beware we reÅ¿t not upon it, for as we are not to conclude our juÅ¿tification from any effects of Å¿anctification, Å¿o we are not to conclude that apprehenÅ¿ion of juÅ¿tification to be from God, which takes us off the means, waies and rules of Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: the Ranters error Å¿prings up in them for want of this diÅ¿tinction.</p>
                  <p>In a word, to Å¿ay no more; duty is the matter of promiÅ¿e, as well as Gods mercy, as doth moÅ¿t clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by theÅ¿e Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 12. EpheÅ¿. 2. 8. Phil. 1. 29. Acts 5. 31. Joh.</hi> 8. 32. And our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converÅ¿ation is not the cauÅ¿e of our Å¿alvation, but the effect; neither do I hold that there is any free will in man, neither do I believe that any man hath, or ever Å¿ince the fall, had any will or power of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf without God to do any thing that is good, for in him, as the Scripture Å¿aith, we live, move, and have our being; Å¿o that in, through, and by God and ChriÅ¿t we may do all things, for he is a Sun, and a Å¿hield, and will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that wait on him, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 84. 11.</p>
                  <p>Yet God hath given all men enough, to leave them without excuÅ¿e; what man is there that knoweth not, that if he make uÅ¿e of all the opportunities, will, power and underÅ¿tanding that God hath given him, but he may avoid more evil, and do more good then he hath done, or doth now do?</p>

               <head>Of JuÅ¿tification and Sanctification, how they differ, and wherein they agree.</head>
               <p>GOD in JuÅ¿tification imputeth the righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t to us; in Sanctification his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit infuÅ¿eth grace in us. In JuÅ¿tification we read Å¿in pardoned, in Sanctification we read Å¿in Å¿ubdued; the one doth free all Believers from the warth of God that they never fall into a Å¿tate of condemnation; the other neither equal in all, nor in this life perfect in any, but going on and growing up to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Again, JuÅ¿tification and Sanctification differ thus; to wit, JuÅ¿tification is the imputing of anothers ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice to us, to wit ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Sanctification is the impreÅ¿Å¿ion of JuÅ¿tice, that it may be in us.</p>
               <p>In JuÅ¿tification, there is Å¿atisfaction of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>In Sanctification, there is the obedience of a ChriÅ¿tian.</p>
               <p>JuÅ¿tification is a perfect and abÅ¿olute undivided act at once; Sanctification is a work begun, not equal in all, but carried on in all by degrees.</p>
               <p>JuÅ¿tification is firÅ¿t; Sanctification afterwards: conÅ¿iÅ¿ting in Å¿eparation from Å¿in, filthineÅ¿s, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pollution.</p>
               <p>JuÅ¿tification and Sanctification are two inÅ¿eparable companions, where one doth dwell, the other will lodge; and as Election is the proper work of the Father, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4. Redemption of the Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. So Sanctification is the proper work
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170103:64"/>
of the Holy-GhoÅ¿t, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
               <p>Now there are four things conÅ¿iderable to Å¿hew us wherein we are to keep our JuÅ¿tification and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication diÅ¿tinct the one from the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to keep JuÅ¿tification and Sanctification diÅ¿tinct, in reÅ¿pect of the Å¿ubject and matter of this, which is not any thing in us, or done by us: but the perÅ¿onal and Å¿potleÅ¿s righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t made over to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is our duty to keep up our IuÅ¿tification di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinct, although it be not accompanied with Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, although there be failings in us; the Prodigal in <hi>Luke</hi> 15. came and confeÅ¿Å¿ed his Å¿in as a Å¿on, and Å¿aid, Father I am not worthy to be called thy Å¿on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We Å¿hould keep our IuÅ¿tification diÅ¿tinct, and not go to reaÅ¿on out our IuÅ¿tification from our Sanctification, but we Å¿hould look to JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, the Rock upon which a ChriÅ¿tian Å¿hould build his Å¿oul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We Å¿hould alwaies keep up, and keep diÅ¿tinct our JuÅ¿tification, as the Å¿pring and way to Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for the fruit of JuÅ¿tification, is peace, joy, boldneÅ¿s and Å¿trength to do the will of God; all this doth come in from JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t in a way of believing, and not from Sanctification; for as we are not to conclude our JuÅ¿tification from any effects of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, Å¿o we are not to conclude that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of JuÅ¿tification to be from God, which takes us off the means, waies and rules of Sanctification: therefore although they be diÅ¿tinct in theÅ¿e four fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned heads, yet they agree, and go hand in hand in theÅ¿e enÅ¿uing things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:170103:64"/>1. They go together in theÅ¿e; he that is juÅ¿tified, doth as earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ire Sanctification and holineÅ¿s, as he doth heaven and happineÅ¿s.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth as well deÅ¿ire, that is juÅ¿tified by ChriÅ¿ts righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, to chuÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t as a King to rule over him, as a Saviour to Å¿ave him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They go together in this reÅ¿pect alÅ¿o; a Å¿oul is not content with the apprehenÅ¿ion of his JuÅ¿tificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleÅ¿s he finds Å¿ome meaÅ¿ure of, and growing up in Sanctification.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They go together, as doth appear by this; the man that is truly juÅ¿tified, he doth make as much care and conÅ¿cience to practiÅ¿e holineÅ¿s, as ever he did to get ChriÅ¿ts righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They go together in this reÅ¿pect alÅ¿o: every diÅ¿covery of ChriÅ¿t and his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s to the Å¿oul for JuÅ¿tification, doth fit and heighten the Å¿ouls reÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for Sanctification and holineÅ¿s.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A man may be Å¿aid to keep his JuÅ¿tification and Sanctification together, when he doth truÅ¿t his Å¿oul in the hands of ChriÅ¿t for Å¿alvation, and makes it his work to die to the world, and to honour ChriÅ¿t in the world.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When a Å¿oul hath found out ChriÅ¿t, for his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tification, he doth make it his great buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to be conformable to him in his converÅ¿ation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. being made conformable to his death.</p>

               <p>O what remains then, but that we labour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿h between our JuÅ¿tification, and our perÅ¿onal Sanctification.

               <p>Surely, by what hath been Å¿aid, it doth moÅ¿t plainly appear, that a ChriÅ¿tians happineÅ¿s depends not upon his own doings, but on ChriÅ¿t, who is of God, made unto us RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, Sanctification, &amp;c. who hath Å¿aved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoÅ¿e and grace. See 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. 2 Tim. 1. 9. Heb.</hi> 13. 8. Sanctification admits of degrees, JuÅ¿tification neither of Rules nor degrees; when we cannot apprehend God in a way of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, yet we are then comprehended of God, though our actual righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s be but as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truous rags, and often fail us, yet then, even then, we have the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t preÅ¿ented to us, <hi>IÅ¿a. 45. 24.

               <p>And this RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, as it is ours by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Å¿o it is perfect and endureth for ever, and is the foundation of all bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿s, therefore let us reÅ¿t Å¿atisfied with ChriÅ¿ts righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and add nothing to it, let our hearts Å¿ay with <hi>David, PÅ¿alm 71. 15, 16, 19, 24.

                  <p>THE ground of believing is the word of God, the Scriptures of truth; he that doth Å¿ay he doth believe in God, having no Scripture ground, he doth deceive himÅ¿elf; the ground of Faith is without our Å¿elves, not a light in us, or any thing done by us: the ground of Faith is, God in his word doth offer us ChriÅ¿t, and ChriÅ¿t cals us unto him, and Å¿aith, he will in no wiÅ¿e caÅ¿t us off, but if we believe in him we Å¿hall have eternal life; now this is a word of truth, and this word of his is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation, and whatÅ¿oever was written aforetime, was written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, <hi>John 20. 31.

                  <p n="2">2. The Scriptures are the ground of Faith, as it is a Å¿ure word: as we are not to believe any thing that is not contained in Scripture, Å¿o we need not doubt of any thing that is promiÅ¿ed in them: they are the faithful Å¿ayings of God.</p>

                  <p>Unbelief binds all our Å¿ins upon the Å¿oul, and Å¿o murders the Å¿oul, it grieves the heart of ChriÅ¿t, leaves all our Å¿ins upon record, leaves us to anÅ¿wer for our Å¿elves: it is a Å¿in againÅ¿t the greateÅ¿t love, againÅ¿t the only remedy, makes void the Doctrine of grace, and breeds an indiÅ¿poÅ¿ition towards all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties: it is a diÅ¿honouring to God, a denying of ChriÅ¿t, a murderer of the Å¿oul, a belying of God, a denying of ChriÅ¿t, and a crowning of Satan; it doth without doubt proclaim the Devil a Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and lift him up above ChriÅ¿t himÅ¿elf. <hi>Judas</hi> did Å¿in more by unbelief, and deÅ¿pairing, then by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ChriÅ¿t.

                  <p>THere are many characters or diÅ¿coveries of this Faith of the GoÅ¿pel, called the Faith of Gods Elect, which worketh by love. FirÅ¿t, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of this Faith is infuÅ¿ed into the Å¿oul, by God in regeneration, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. Secondly, this habit Å¿o infuÅ¿ed, is brought to act by the Fathers drawing the Å¿oul to ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 44. Thirdly, faith being thus infuÅ¿ed and acted, doth chearfully accept of ChriÅ¿t upon his own terms, <hi>viz.</hi> Å¿elf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, bearing the CroÅ¿s and following ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Luke 9. 23. Iohn</hi> 1. 12. Faith having thus accepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ChriÅ¿t, begins to taÅ¿te Å¿uch Å¿weetneÅ¿s and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿antneÅ¿s in him, that ChriÅ¿t is moÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ant to the Å¿oul, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 3, 7. So the Å¿oul by degrees comes to be filled with joy and peace in believing. Again, Faith having thus taken and taÅ¿ted ChriÅ¿t, contends after a fuller perfection, even after aÅ¿Å¿urance, <hi>Col. 2. 2. Heb.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True Faith is not only a juÅ¿tifying grace, but a Å¿anctifying grace, <hi>Acts 15. 9. &amp;</hi> 26. 8. the blood of ChriÅ¿t i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170103:73"/>
So faith is a grace not only to acquit, but alÅ¿o to purge and renew the perÅ¿on where it dwells. It is not only an enlightening grace, but it is alÅ¿o a conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace; therefore we read that it doth ingraft us into the Å¿imilitude of his death, and in the fellowÅ¿hip of his Å¿ufferings and ReÅ¿urrection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>Now then enquire; is there vertue gone from ChriÅ¿t to make thy dark mind Å¿eeing, thy Å¿tubborn judgement yielding, thy proud heart humbling, thy filthy heart cleanÅ¿ing, thy hard heart relenting and mourning, thy carnal affections to be heavenly, thy Å¿inful Å¿oul to be holy? Read and well conÅ¿ider that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where there is true Faith, it will cauÅ¿e the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make a curious, narrow, impartial, diligent Å¿earch into his own heart and Å¿oul, to Å¿ee what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, what Å¿elf-denyal, what Å¿in abhorrency, what love to ChriÅ¿t, what delight to the Ordinances, what zeal for Gods glory, what contempt of the world, what deÅ¿ires after the Å¿ociety of the Saints, what Å¿ympathizing with them in their afflictions? and if upon this Å¿earch thou findeÅ¿t any impreÅ¿Å¿ions of grace, any Å¿piritual work, any Å¿avouring, Å¿avory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tinguiÅ¿hing operations upon thy heart, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath been there, and begun to work the grace of Faith in thy heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

So that the Å¿oul Å¿its down, and often Å¿aith, O Lord, O Lord, in my Å¿elf
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170103:74"/>
I am nothing, nay of my Å¿elf worÅ¿e then nothing. But what I am, I am by grace, all that I have is thine, my bread, my health, my life, my body, my Å¿oul, all is thine.

I have nothing but what I have received, thou only art the cauÅ¿e, I am leÅ¿s then the leaÅ¿t of thy mercies, and what is thy Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that thou Å¿houldÅ¿t look on Å¿uch an one as I am? thou madeÅ¿t me, and thou boughteÅ¿t me, and thou calledÅ¿t me, and thou juÅ¿tifieÅ¿t me, and thou Å¿aveÅ¿t me.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. True Faith doth deÅ¿ire and endeavour after an increaÅ¿e; Help my unbelief, Å¿aid the weak believing Father. <hi>O Lord encreaÅ¿e our Faith,</hi> Å¿aid the DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; there are yet many degrees wanting to faith; either thou canÅ¿t not be perÅ¿waded, or not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿waded, or not conÅ¿tantly perÅ¿waded; but if the Faith be true and living, it will bend after a riÅ¿ing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. True Faith in ChriÅ¿t, and a mournful heart for Å¿in alwaies go together, <hi>Zach.</hi> 10 12. They Å¿hall look upon me whom they have pierced, and mourn, &amp;c. there are two things that Faith will fetch up in the Å¿oul, the one is love to ChriÅ¿t, another is Å¿orrow for Å¿in.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. True Faith is fruitful, <hi>James</hi> 2. 18. See <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 18. Although works do not cauÅ¿e Faith, or JuÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yet they do clearly manifeÅ¿t to others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have Faith yea or no.</p>
                  <p>To cloÅ¿e up this point, let me acquaint the Reader,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170103:74"/>
that there are Å¿piritual and inward characters of Faith, which Å¿erve as evidences to him that hath it, many of thoÅ¿e I have hinted at under this fore-going head. Secondly there are outward or more external Å¿igns of Faith, and they conÅ¿iÅ¿t in walking, Å¿o in the Å¿ight of men, that they may in charity judge of our Faith by our works: then there are characters of a Å¿trong Faith, and alÅ¿o Å¿igns of a weak Faith: FirÅ¿t of a Å¿trong Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. he Å¿taggered not at the promiÅ¿e through unbelief. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8.

                  <p n="4">4. By it we give the greateÅ¿t honour to God, <hi>John 3. 33. He hath Å¿et to his Å¿eal that God is true,

                  <p>Faith in ChriÅ¿t Å¿upplies all wants, it honours God, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. the whole Chapter: and God honours thoÅ¿e moÅ¿t that live by it: by it, Å¿aith the Scripture, the Elders obtained a good report; by faith we may live a life to God, of joy in him our righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, as if we had never Å¿inned; by faith we live above Å¿in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, temptations, deÅ¿ertions, Å¿enÅ¿e, reaÅ¿on, fears and doubts: Faith Å¿weetens the Å¿weeteÅ¿t mercy, and the bittereÅ¿t miÅ¿eries, it renders great afflictions as none, it is the bulwark of the Å¿ouls Å¿trength and comfort: by Faith we cheerfully, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and univerÅ¿ally, and conÅ¿tantly obey God.

By faith we view the glory of heaven, and know our Å¿elves to be happy, even then when to a carnal eye we Å¿eem moÅ¿t miÅ¿erable. By faith we can cheerfully part with, and Å¿uffer deprivation of the Å¿weeteÅ¿t outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and enjoyments, and welcome them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we do but exchange the worÅ¿t things, and place for a better; thoÅ¿e that live up by faith, live upon God, and are refreÅ¿hed in his houÅ¿e, which is

                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> 1. Ground or reaÅ¿on, why believing on the Son of God is Å¿o hard, is becauÅ¿e every thing in man doth fight againÅ¿t it: hence it doth come to paÅ¿s, that believing doth require the greateÅ¿t piece of Å¿elf-denyal in them: for a man to break the Law, and yet to be freed from the curÅ¿e of the Law, this reaÅ¿on cannot comprehend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ground why Å¿o few believe, is, either becauÅ¿e they think they do believe already, and yet do not; or elÅ¿e they would believe, but Å¿ay they cannot: FirÅ¿t they think they do believe, and yet do not, and theÅ¿e are of three Å¿orts; FirÅ¿t, ignorant perÅ¿ons: now ignorance and unbelief, they alwayes go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; we read of <hi>Paul</hi> that did things before he was converted, in ignorance and unbelief. <hi>Jer. 4. 22. My people are fooliÅ¿h, they know not me, to do good they have no knowledge.</hi> Secondly, thoÅ¿e that boaÅ¿t and glory in their own righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, theÅ¿e have no faith in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t and his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s. The third Å¿ort of people that do think they do believe and do not, are prophane perÅ¿ons, and theÅ¿e be of two Å¿orts, men of prophane Å¿pirits, and men of prophane lives, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane practices.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ground or reaÅ¿on why Å¿o few believe, is, becauÅ¿e it is the great deÅ¿ign of Satan either to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or overthrow our Faith; becauÅ¿e believing doth give the greateÅ¿t glory to God, and brings in the greateÅ¿t good to us. FirÅ¿t, it doth give the greateÅ¿t
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170103:79"/>
glory to God of any work in the world, it doth give glory to his truth and faithfulneÅ¿s, and power, and mindfulneÅ¿s.

                  <p n="4">4. ReaÅ¿on why believing is Å¿o hard a work, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e of the multitude of falÅ¿e Doctrines that there are in the world, that a man Å¿carce knows who to hear, or whom to believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>REpentance and faith are two inÅ¿eparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; where the one doth dwell the other will lodge, in the Covenant of grace there is place for repentance, and mercy for the penitent. Let us firÅ¿t enquire what true repentance is, <hi>viz.</hi> Some Å¿ay repentance is a grieving for Å¿in, both original and actual, ariÅ¿ing from an apprehenÅ¿ion of diÅ¿pleaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿o loving a God, 2. <hi>Cor. 7. 11. For behold this Å¿elf-Å¿ame thing that ye Å¿orrowed after a godly Å¿ort: what carefulneÅ¿s it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your Å¿elves? yea what indignation? yea what fear? yea what vehement deÅ¿ire? yea what zeal? yea what revenge in all things?</hi> &amp;c. Repentance is not only a turning from evil to good, but a hating the evil we turn from, and a loving the good we turn to.</p>
               <p>True repentance is a general univerÅ¿al change of the whole man in every part; though it be but in part, it doth change both heart and life, word and work, it makes darkneÅ¿s light, and bitter Å¿weet<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

and a Leaper an Angel, <hi>IÅ¿a. 1. 16, 17, 18. WaÅ¿h ye, make ye clean:</hi> there is the change of the heart: <hi>put away the evil of your doings,</hi> there is the change of the life. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30, 31, 32. Or repentance is a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿al change in the whole man, the underÅ¿tanding is turned from darkneÅ¿s to light: the will from Å¿infulÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude to an holy liberty: the affections from diÅ¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into order, the heart from hardneÅ¿s into Å¿oftneÅ¿s: Å¿o the eye of wantoneÅ¿s into an eye of chaÅ¿tity: the uncircumciÅ¿ed ear into an obedient ear: the hands of bribery into the hands of liberty: and the feet of vanity into the waies of purity. Repentance for Å¿in is nothing, without repentance from Å¿in.</p>
               <p>He that hath repented indeed, doth Å¿till deÅ¿ire to have his Å¿in purged, as well as pardoned: repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a work that muÅ¿t be timely done, or we be utterly undone: he that hath truly repented, doth now Å¿trike moÅ¿t at thoÅ¿e Å¿ins that he was moÅ¿t prone to before: the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.

Sin is called mire, and Å¿inners Å¿wine: the leaÅ¿t Å¿in virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more or leÅ¿s, contains in it the nature of all Å¿in; no Å¿ooner did one Å¿in Å¿et upon <hi>Adams</hi> heart, but he had all Å¿in in him; every Å¿in doth put God upon complaining, ChriÅ¿t upon bleeding, and the Spirit upon grieving, and the Å¿oul a mourning: many Å¿in by omiÅ¿Å¿ion and commiÅ¿Å¿ion, at one and the Å¿ame time, and yet know of neither: the more there is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170103:81"/>
of the will in the acting of Å¿in, the greater the Å¿in is. Some Å¿ins of omiÅ¿Å¿ion may exceed Å¿ome of commiÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the more deliberation, and the weaker tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions any hath, and yet Å¿inneth, the greater the Å¿in is.</p>
               <p>Many a man is full of Å¿inful corruption, but Å¿hew it not for want of occaÅ¿ion. No Å¿ooner did one Å¿in Å¿eize upon <hi>Adams</hi> heart, but he had all Å¿in in him.</p>

                  <p>God had one Å¿on without corruption, but no Å¿on without correction; he had one Å¿on without Å¿in, but no Å¿on without Å¿orrow: Sin will coÅ¿t a ChriÅ¿tian more grief, Å¿orrow, heart-bleeding, and Å¿oul-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before conÅ¿cience will be Å¿atisfied, and comfort reÅ¿tored, and evidences cleared, and pard on in the Court of conÅ¿cience Å¿ealed: For God is as Å¿evere in puniÅ¿hing, as he is gracious in pardoning, his houÅ¿e of correction is his School of inÅ¿truction; Sin doth make God look Å¿everely, and chide bitterly, and Å¿trike heavily, even where and when he loves dearly. <hi>IÅ¿aiah 59. 2.

                  <p>SIN may live where it doth not reign, and dwell where it is not welcom; it is true, the Scripture doth Å¿ay, they that are ChriÅ¿ts, have crucified the fleÅ¿h, with the affections and luÅ¿ts; but here the Scripture doth not Å¿peak of a total Å¿ubduing of Å¿in, as if every luÅ¿t and corruption Å¿hould be quite Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but only this far, to give a deadly blow to Å¿in, that Å¿in Å¿hall not reign nor bear Å¿way in thy Å¿oul as it hath done formerly; the dominion of Å¿in is taken away, but the life and being of it is continued for a little time. As <hi>Hagar</hi> would dwell with <hi>Sarah</hi> till Å¿he beat her out of doors: Å¿o will Å¿in dwell with grace, till death beat it out of doors: there Å¿hall be Å¿ome remainders of Å¿in Å¿till in the beÅ¿t of Gods Å¿ervants, but Å¿in Å¿hall not reign in their mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; Å¿in may live in a Saint, and yet the Saint not live in Å¿in.</p>
                  <p>Let us now examine in what caÅ¿es, and with what limitations Å¿trength of corruption may conÅ¿iÅ¿t with Å¿trength of grace? the reÅ¿olving of this queÅ¿tion is of very much uÅ¿e.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. If you find a Å¿trong oppoÅ¿ition againÅ¿t your corruptions, though you cannot fully Å¿ubdue Å¿in, yet do you Å¿trongly oppoÅ¿e it: then there is Å¿trength of grace in the Å¿oul, though there be Å¿trong corruptions in the body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is Å¿trength of grace, where there is Å¿trong cries to God againÅ¿t thy Å¿ins, this argues grace, and the Å¿trength of grace, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is Å¿trength of grace in that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is reÅ¿olved in the Å¿trength of ChriÅ¿t, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his Å¿trong Å¿ins, or die conquering of them; our Lord ChriÅ¿t when two things were Å¿et before him, either to Å¿in or die, he choÅ¿e death, rather then Å¿in, and by degrees he works his SpouÅ¿e to the Å¿ame mind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Å¿trength of grace may be conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with Å¿trength of corruptions, I might inÅ¿tance in many precious Saints, I will mention one for all the reÅ¿t, and that is in <hi>Peter;</hi> who had not only truth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, but eminency and Å¿trength of grace: For though temptations and corruptions did Å¿ometimes prevail, yet he had Å¿trong affections towards ChriÅ¿t, he did out-Å¿trip many of the DiÅ¿ciples.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Peter</hi> was the firÅ¿t that ran to the Sepulchre to Å¿ee what was become of JeÅ¿us, <hi>John</hi> 20. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He was the man who hearing that ChriÅ¿t was riÅ¿en, leapt into the Sea for joy, <hi>John</hi> 21. 7.</p>

                  <p n="5">5.

To cloÅ¿e up this, firÅ¿t of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in general, let me tell the Reader, that a man without knowledge, is as a workman without hands, or as a painter without eyes, or as a traveller without legs, or as a Å¿hip without Å¿ails, or as a bird without wings, or as a body without a Å¿oul: there is a threefold knowledge or illumination: FirÅ¿t, general and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the light of ReaÅ¿on.

Thirdly, there is a knowledge of middle illumination betwixt theÅ¿e two, more then meerly natural, but leÅ¿s then truly Å¿uperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>

                  <p>IT is a moÅ¿t excellent thing for a ChriÅ¿tian to know himÅ¿elf, and then at the beÅ¿t, he would Å¿ee himÅ¿elf to be but vanity, and an unpofitable Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to God, and Å¿o begin to ceaÅ¿e from man, whoÅ¿e breath is in his noÅ¿trils.

Secondly, the will of man is wholly depraved, as being contrary to God, his will, word and Å¿pirit in all things: it will not depend nor wait on God, it is unconÅ¿tant in good reÅ¿olutions, it is very apt to diÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the will of God, as we may Å¿ee in Father <hi>Adam.</hi> Thirdly, as for the memory, that is alÅ¿o full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that it will forget the things that it Å¿hould remember, and remember the things it Å¿hould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get;

it will hold faÅ¿t trifles, and let go matters of moment.

                  <p n="1">1. THE knowledge that is from God, Å¿ubjects the Å¿oul to God: but the knowledge that is in the brain is notional, and neither Å¿ubdues Å¿in nor Satan.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Spiritual, experimental knowledge is a free gift of God, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. God who commanded the light to Å¿hine out of darkneÅ¿s, hath Å¿hined in our hearts, to give in the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> This Divine light doth reach the heart as well as the head.</p>

Like as the child receiveth from the parents, member for member, limb for limb, or as the paper from the preÅ¿s, receiveth letter for letter, or as the face in a glaÅ¿s, anÅ¿wereth to the face, Å¿o the beams of Divine knowledge, Å¿hining into the Å¿oul, Å¿tamps the lively Image of ChriÅ¿t upon the Å¿oul, and makes him put on the Lord JeÅ¿us, and reÅ¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him. God will own no knowledge at laÅ¿t, but that which leaves the Å¿tamp of ChriÅ¿t, the print of ChriÅ¿t, and the Image of ChriÅ¿t upon the heart.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

The root of luÅ¿t is error; when ChriÅ¿t takes away the foundation, the luÅ¿t dyes, and the Devils work is diÅ¿Å¿olved. FirÅ¿t, the luÅ¿t of the eye: ChriÅ¿t informs the Å¿oul that there is no Å¿uch excellency in riches; but that they are droÅ¿s and dung, and therefore why Å¿hould the eye or heart be Å¿et upon them: So this luÅ¿t is diÅ¿Å¿olved, there is an end of it.</p>

                  </p>

A good underÅ¿tanding have all they that do his commandments:</hi> God doth not meaÅ¿ure our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by our queÅ¿tions and diÅ¿putes, but by our practices, as in <hi>Jer. 22. 16.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take this alÅ¿o, that it is not the wanting of Å¿ome meaÅ¿ures or degrees of knowledge, that doth make a man ignorant in the Å¿ight of God, but the want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of true knowledge of the Father, Son, Spirit, and Scriptures.</p>

               <p>OF the nature of this love.</p>
               <p>Although ChriÅ¿tians do Å¿omewhat differ in their defining it, what it is, yet in the eÅ¿Å¿ence or body of it they agree; but before I can orderly come to Å¿peak of the Å¿everal definitions that ChriÅ¿tians give of it, I muÅ¿t acquaint the Reader of the Å¿everal Å¿orts of love, <hi>viz.</hi> there is a love natural, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a love Å¿inful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there is a love Å¿piritual.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is love of pitty, as in a Father to a Å¿ick and vitious Å¿on, or one friend to another in miÅ¿ery: or if you pleaÅ¿e there is,</p>

               <p n="3">3. There is a love of complacency: So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is well pleaÅ¿ed with an obedient Å¿on, the husband with a vertuous wife, the School-maÅ¿ter with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Scholar.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a love of friendÅ¿hip, when a man doth both honour and reÅ¿pect Å¿uch and Å¿uch good people, and is Å¿o beloved of them again.</p>

               <p n="1">1. One Å¿aith, it is an holy diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the heart ariÅ¿ing from faith, whereby we cleave to the Lord, with a purpoÅ¿e of heart to Å¿erve him, and to pleaÅ¿e him in all things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Å¿aith love is a grace wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God, in perÅ¿wading the party of Gods love to it; and Å¿o the Å¿oul comes to love God, becauÅ¿e he did firÅ¿t love him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others Å¿ay, it is a Å¿upernatural grace flowing from Faith, inÅ¿tilled by God himÅ¿elf, whereby through the mercy of God we Å¿ee the great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of him, and thereby are drawn to love and yield obedience to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Others Å¿ay it is an holy affection, or act of the will, or diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the heart, whereby it cleaves or makes forward to Å¿ome good, that is agreeable to it Å¿elf.</p>

                  <p>BEÅ¿ides what hath been Å¿poken in the foregoing head, there are Å¿everal Å¿orts and kinds of love; as, FirÅ¿t there is a fleÅ¿hly and carnal love, which is altogether Å¿inful. Secondly, there is a naturall ove, as in a Parent to a child, and one relation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thirdly, there is a civil love, Å¿uch as one neighbour and friend hath to another. Fourthly, there is a religious love, and that is twofold, the one is Å¿ubordinate to the other, <hi>viz.</hi> FirÅ¿t there is our love to God. Secondly to his people, as they bear his image. FirÅ¿t to God himÅ¿elf, who is the very eÅ¿Å¿ence of love, he is nothing elÅ¿e but love, God is love, neither Å¿hould there be any thing beloved by us, but as it either conveys love to us from him, or elÅ¿e deaws up our affections to him; there is alÅ¿o a love to our enemies required of us, which we ought to be found in the practiÅ¿e of, in obedience to the command of God, and in love and pitty to their poor Å¿ouls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44.</p>
                  <p>But that love that I Å¿hall treat of is, that love Å¿poken to in Scripture, which is Å¿hed abroad in our hearts by the Holy GhoÅ¿t, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5.</p>

                  <p>THE Lord tells us by <hi>Paul, Rom. 5. 5. That the Love of God is Å¿hed abroad in our hearts by the Holy GhoÅ¿t:</hi> he Å¿hews us that he loveth us that were of no worth, and whileÅ¿t we were in our Å¿ins, that he dyed for us, and then he doth Å¿hed the Å¿enÅ¿e and feeling thereof abroad in our hearts, whereby we come to taÅ¿te and Å¿ee how good and gracious the Lord is, <hi>PÅ¿alm</hi> 34. 8.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Spring of love is this, the Lord doth unveil himÅ¿elf a little to the Å¿oul, whereby it Å¿ees his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, <hi>viz.</hi> wiÅ¿dom, power, riches, beauty, glory, faithfulneÅ¿s and amiableneÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Spring of love is this, the Å¿oul having Å¿een Å¿omething of his excellency, and Å¿o loves him, not only becauÅ¿e of that, although he be moÅ¿t worthy of love, but alÅ¿o becauÅ¿e he hath caÅ¿t his love upon us: and Å¿o in the Å¿econd place, the Å¿oul comes to love ChriÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e he firÅ¿t loved us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 10, 19. as fire begets fire, Å¿o doth love beget love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Spring of love is this, after the Å¿oul hath Å¿een the worth of ChriÅ¿t, and the love of ChriÅ¿t, it comes in the next place to Å¿ee that the love of all relations doth meet in the love of ChriÅ¿t: and this doth raiÅ¿e up a ChriÅ¿tian to love ChriÅ¿t with a Å¿upream love: Love is as a Load-Å¿tone, drawing the affections to love ChriÅ¿t, as to one that is aimable and lovely, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and glorious, Å¿potleÅ¿s and matchleÅ¿s, in his name, in his nature, in his offices, in his graces, in his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170103:100"/>
gifts, in his diÅ¿coveries, in his appearances; in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, he is full of gravity, majeÅ¿ty, and mercy, and glory, he is the chiefeÅ¿t among ten thouÅ¿and, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. So the Å¿oul loves ChriÅ¿t for that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable goodneÅ¿s and natural Å¿weetneÅ¿s that there is in him. But others that Å¿ee it not, reject thoÅ¿e gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious invitations, reject the Kings Supper, and think it Å¿trange that thou runneÅ¿t not with him to the Å¿ame exceÅ¿s of riot.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Spring of love is this, the Lord preÅ¿ents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Å¿oul, FirÅ¿t his love in giving ChriÅ¿t. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the love of ChriÅ¿t in giving himÅ¿elf, and this many times takes with a Å¿oul, and makes it break forth in theÅ¿e or the like expreÅ¿Å¿ions; O the love of God to Å¿inners, to give his Å¿on, and not a Å¿ervant, his own Å¿on and not another, his only Å¿on and not a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, his only begotten Å¿on, and not an adopted Å¿on, that he Å¿hould Å¿end and give him, when he was not Å¿ought by us, but freely given by him to us, not friends but enemies! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the next place conÅ¿ider, the love of ChriÅ¿t in giving himÅ¿elf; O how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful was his love to us, it was not a love to the fallen Angels, but to fallen man! Oh what hath he undergone for us! O that he that was equal with God Å¿hould come in the form of a Å¿ervant! That he that the heaven of heavens could not contain, Å¿hould be cradled in a Manger, and from his cradle to his CroÅ¿s, his whole life was a life of Å¿orrows! Oh that the Judge of all fleÅ¿h Å¿hould be condemned, the Lord of Life put to death, that he that was crowned with honour and glory, Å¿hould be crowned with thorns! That that face that was white and ruddy, Å¿hould be Å¿pit upon by the beaÅ¿tly Jews! and that

He was tempted by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, reviled by the High PrieÅ¿ts, branded for a Babler, Wine-bibber, and Sabbath-breaker, and BlaÅ¿phemer! all this he Å¿uffered for us out of love to us, Å¿hall we not love him? his true love to us will be Å¿atisfied with nothing but love againâThis is another Spring of love.</p>

                  <head>Of the Properties of this true Love.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WHere there is love to God, and faith in ChriÅ¿t, it makes the Å¿oul long for, and earneÅ¿tly deÅ¿ire the appearing of ChriÅ¿t, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. There is a Crown of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s laid up for all them that love his appearing:</hi> as when we love any, we love their preÅ¿ence. It is true, Å¿ometimes good men are afraid to die, but it is becauÅ¿e they would be better fitted for their Bridegrooms coming: beÅ¿ides the beÅ¿t have fleÅ¿h as well as Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another property of love is this: Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to Å¿peak well of the party beloved. <hi>David</hi> abounded in love to God, and therefore could never Å¿atisfie himÅ¿elf in Å¿peaking of, and praiÅ¿ing him, <hi>PÅ¿alm</hi> 105.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Love is bountiful and Å¿eeks not its own, as doth abundantly appear in this bleÅ¿Å¿ed portion of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another property of love is this, it will put the whole man to work for the party beloved: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Will, Affections, Tongue and Hand, and all will fall to work, when others Å¿tand frozen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed: Å¿urely the heart that loves ChriÅ¿t is Å¿till drawing nearer and nearer to him, aÅ¿piring towards heaven, and thriving in the work of grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And laÅ¿tly, love commandeth the affections, of anger and fear, it moderates the one, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the other.</p>
                  <p>What Å¿hall I Å¿ay more of the properties of this love? he that hath this love of God Å¿hed abroad in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170103:103"/>
his heart, doth look upon ChriÅ¿t as the chiefeÅ¿t among ten thouÅ¿and, and Å¿o Å¿peaks good of his name, <hi>PÅ¿al. 34. 8. O taÅ¿te and Å¿ee that the Lord is good,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, a Å¿oul comes to love him for himÅ¿elf, becauÅ¿e he is the object of love. And Å¿o this man grieves when he is either diÅ¿honoured or Å¿lighted.</p>

                  <head>Of the motives or inducements to perÅ¿wade us to get into, and grow up in this Love.</head>
                  <p>THE motives to perÅ¿wade us to make out after this love, may be drawn from, either the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that we Å¿hall get by it; or from the hurt or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in neglecting it. To begin then with the laÅ¿t firÅ¿t, 2 <hi>Cor. 16. 22. If any man love not the Lord IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, let him be curÅ¿ed with a double curÅ¿e,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Iohn 4. 8. He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love:</hi> and if we know him not. 2 <hi>TheÅ¿. 1. 8. he will come in flaming fire taking vonge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on them that know him not. Iohn</hi> 5. 42. TheÅ¿e people have not the love of God in them. <hi>Ioh. 8. 42. IeÅ¿us Å¿aid to them, if God were your father, ye would love me,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 10. In this the children of God are manifeÅ¿t, and the children of the Devil; whoÅ¿oever doth not righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brorher: in a word, there is nothing that we Å¿ay or do that will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Lord without this love, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 1, 2, 3. Though I Å¿peak with the tongue of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and though I have the gift of prophecy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand all myÅ¿teries, and though I beÅ¿tow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, and have not this love, I am nothing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conÅ¿ider the excellency of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170103:103"/>
it, and the benefits we Å¿hall get thereby. FirÅ¿t, it is moÅ¿t like to God, 1 <hi>John 4. 16. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God.</hi> Again, it is called by <hi>David,</hi> a joyful, bleÅ¿Å¿ed and pleaÅ¿ant thing: Again, it is recorded in Scripture as one of our evidences for heaven, 1 <hi>John 3. 14. By this we know we have paÅ¿Å¿ed from death to life, becauÅ¿e we love the brethren:</hi> and our love to our brethren is a Å¿ign of our love to God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 20. LaÅ¿tly, love will Å¿tand when all other graces will fail, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. Love never faileth, ver. 13. now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, theÅ¿e three, but the greateÅ¿t of theÅ¿e is Charity.</p>

                  <head>Of our love to the children of God, the nature of it, the tryals of it, the means of attaining it, and impediments that hinder it.</head>
                  <p>1. OF the nature of it: ChriÅ¿t is nothing elÅ¿e but love, and there Å¿hould not any thing be beloved by us, but as it either conveys love from him<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> or elÅ¿e draws up our affections unto him; and our loving of his body the Church, will effect both theÅ¿e. The nature then of this love, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under theÅ¿e enÅ¿uing heads. When we love them, as Å¿uch in whom we Å¿ee the Image of ChriÅ¿t, for their Å¿piritual brother-hood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. The godly for godlineÅ¿s Å¿ake, for God in them: ChriÅ¿tians for ChriÅ¿tianity, for ChriÅ¿t in them; the Saints for their Saint-Å¿hip, for their Sanctity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on and converÅ¿ation; The Å¿piritual children begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for their Heavenly Fathers Å¿ake: when grace is

the principal load-Å¿tone of our affection; when for this we love them, more then for beauty, Å¿weetneÅ¿s of diÅ¿poÅ¿ition, birth, breeding, learning, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, gifts, wealth, honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Å¿o love all Å¿uch as we apprehend to be the children of God; for he that truly loves one child of God, as a child of God, loves every child of God, whether noble or ignoble, rich or poor, bond or free, male or female; for the Å¿ame God, the Å¿ame ChriÅ¿t, the Å¿ame grace, is as truly amiable in one, as in another. See <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>Hence we alÅ¿o come to love them moÅ¿t, that are moÅ¿t gracious, for where grace allures the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more grace there is in any perÅ¿on, there is the Å¿tronger motive and allurement to love more. JeÅ¿us loved all his DiÅ¿ciples, <hi>John 13. 1. But John he loved eminently above all the reÅ¿t, John</hi> 21. 20. And Å¿o as grace grows in the Å¿ame perÅ¿on, true love towards him will grow proportionably.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. What delight do we take in their company; we are often in the company of thoÅ¿e that we take no delight in: Now do we indeed delight in the Å¿ociety of the Saints: then we love them, <hi>PÅ¿alm</hi> 16. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, Å¿uch things as we love, we keep with care, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s with joy, and looÅ¿e with grief: Å¿o much of the inward tryals of our love to the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Next of the external tryals of this love, by which we may know, that others do love us, and by which they may know that we love them.</p>
                  <p>But theÅ¿e evidences are not Å¿o infallible as the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170103:105"/>
other, we read <hi>John 13. 35. By this Å¿hall all men know that ye are my DiÅ¿ciples, if ye have love one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:</hi> and how doth our love unto another appear, but in theÅ¿e or the like things, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He that doth love his brother, will be apt to reprove him when he doth ill, and praiÅ¿e him when he doth well; a friend can bear a Å¿harp reproof from a friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another evidence of love is this, we acquaint thoÅ¿e whom we love with our miÅ¿eries, lay open our griefs, and account it Å¿ome eaÅ¿e to diÅ¿charge Å¿ome of our Å¿orrows into their boÅ¿oms; their advice we ask, and from them we look for aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where love is in the heart, it will appear in the tongue, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Love is kind, but there is a great deal of verbal and complementary love with men, forbidden in the Scriptures of truth, Å¿aying, love not in word and tongue, but in deed and in truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another Character of love is this, when thou haÅ¿t Å¿ome injuries offered thee, thou wilt not Å¿oon be angry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. love Å¿uffereth long.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="1">1. FIrÅ¿t, this hope as an inward principle, works out pollution, and corruption, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant thereunto, 1 <hi>John 3. 3. And every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth himÅ¿elf, as he is pure.</hi>

Hope is alwaies more or leÅ¿s exerciÅ¿ed about heavenly things, <hi>viz.</hi> Sometimes it is exerciÅ¿ed about the righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of ChriÅ¿t, Å¿ometimes it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿ed about the love of God the Father in giving ChriÅ¿t: Å¿ometimes hope is exerciÅ¿ed about the word and promiÅ¿es, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 119. 49, 81, 114. and <hi>PÅ¿a. 130. 5. In thy word do I hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hope in the promiÅ¿es will keep the head from aking, and the heart from Å¿inking: in a word, the promiÅ¿es are the ladder by which hope gets up to heaven, and Å¿o hope in the promiÅ¿es will Å¿upport a diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿oul, and reduce a wandring Å¿oul: hope in the promiÅ¿es will confirm Å¿taggering Å¿ouls, and Å¿ome undone Å¿ouls: The promiÅ¿es are the Anchor of hope, as hope is the Anchor of the Å¿oul, See <hi>Rom. 8. 24. Gal. 5. 5. Tit.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hope hath much in reverÅ¿ion, though little in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion; hope can Å¿ee a glimpÅ¿e of heaven through the thickeÅ¿t cloud; hope can Å¿ee light through darkneÅ¿s, life through death, Å¿miles through frowns, and glory through miÅ¿ery; hope holds life and Å¿oul the together; it holds the Å¿oul and the promiÅ¿es toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it holds the Å¿oul and heaven together.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. Another property of hope is this, it will help a Å¿oul to wait patiently upon God, for any thing it doth Å¿tand in need of, <hi>Rom. 8. 25. For if we hope for that we Å¿ee not, then do we with patience wait for it.</hi>

                  <p>But a preÅ¿umptuous hope, that hopes for heaven, as its end, but never acts holineÅ¿s, as its way to heaven: in a word, falÅ¿e hope doth hope much and act little. Wicked men will hope for Å¿alvation, but not work out their Å¿alvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Ye were Å¿ometimes darkneÅ¿s, but now are ye light in the Lord.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. He gives repentance, which is a flower that grows not in natures garden. <hi>Jer. 13. 23. The Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian cannot change his skin, nor the Leopard his Å¿pots;</hi> and that he doth give repentance as a gift to his, doth appear by theÅ¿e Scriptures, <hi>Acts 5. 31. 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 25.</p>

                  <p>In a word, the Lord doth give his people Å¿piritual and heavenly gifts, pure gifts, wine without water, light without darkneÅ¿s, gold without droÅ¿s. See <hi>Rev. 22. 1. James</hi> 3. 17. He gives Å¿oul-Å¿atisfying gifts, moÅ¿t permanent and laÅ¿ting, and moÅ¿t uÅ¿eful gifts. I had intended to have written Å¿omething of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Common and Special gifts, and of the vaÅ¿t difference between the gifts that ChriÅ¿t gives, and thoÅ¿e the world gives; But my Book I Å¿ee would then Å¿well too big, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>I Å¿hall to this add but this word, ChriÅ¿t doth vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and freely give theÅ¿e gifts and graces; never did a mother more willingly give her child Å¿uck, then JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t beÅ¿tows grace upon his people. <hi>IÅ¿a. 55. 1. Rev.</hi> 22. 17.</p>

                  <p>THE Church of God is in Scripture reÅ¿embled to a natural body, wherein are many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers united to each other, and to one head, by one Spirit: now in order to this union, we are to aÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our Å¿elves together in obedience to that great command. <hi>Heb. 10. 25. Not for Å¿aking the aÅ¿Å¿embling of your Å¿elves together, as the manner of Å¿ome is. PÅ¿al. 122. 1.

And Å¿o goes out by the foot-Å¿teps of the flock, and propounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf to the Church, and puts himÅ¿elf upon the tryal of the truth of that work of grace in his heart: So that a Church is at firÅ¿t gathered by the word preached and faith received of them that hear it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. but to come to particulars, I Å¿hall according to my meaÅ¿ure Å¿peak or write of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of aÅ¿Å¿embling under theÅ¿e two heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it relates<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to thoÅ¿e that are converted, but never as yet joyned to any Church of ChriÅ¿t.</p>

For firÅ¿t the Lord in his Word doth command it. And Å¿econdly the example of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Saints, whoÅ¿e foot-Å¿teps we are to follow, doth call for it; and therefore you no Å¿ooner read

of a people converted, but the next news, they were baptized and added to the Churches: and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on why: becauÅ¿e God commands us not to forÅ¿ake the aÅ¿Å¿embling of our Å¿elves together. And Å¿econdly, although our being depends not upon our joyning with a Church of Saints, yet our well-being doth much depend upon it: If any ask how or by what means is a Church at firÅ¿t gathered? I would Å¿ay to them again.

                     <p>2. In the end of this meeting appoint your next meeting, both time and place, expecting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence of ChriÅ¿t with you to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t and teach you, according to his promiÅ¿e, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. See the aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿emblies Annotations on this verÅ¿e.</p>
                     <p>3. You having proceeded thus far, you may look upon your Å¿elves as a Church of ChriÅ¿t in its infancy, and when other ChriÅ¿tians by the word preached, and Faith received, deÅ¿ire to joyn with you in this or the next meeting, let their names be propounded, which being done, let the brethren appoint a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to confer with them about the time when, the place where, the manner how the Lord did firÅ¿t appear to them in a powerful conviction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ion, and regeneration, or Å¿omething equivolent thereunto: and if they give Å¿uch an account of the work of grace upon their hearts, as doth Å¿atisfie the brethren, that the Lord hath begun a work in this creature, that he hath promiÅ¿ed to finiÅ¿h, as in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. Then you are to proceed to a Å¿econd queÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being as before Å¿atisfied in the firÅ¿t; that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a hewed and Å¿quared Å¿tone, and a living Å¿tone, fit for the Å¿piritual building: in the next place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Å¿aid party that deÅ¿ires to joyn with you; what is his or her grounds and ends in deÅ¿iring fellowÅ¿hip with you, and if you find that their grounds be in obedience to the command of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. and their ends be, that they might enjoy God in all his ordinances, and have a fellowÅ¿hip with thoÅ¿e that have fellowÅ¿hip with the Father and the Son, as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170103:116"/>
is, being united by Faith to ChriÅ¿t and his members, he may pertake of his grace, and Å¿piritual life from him, and by him be united to God the Father, and have communion with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                     <p>All that are admitted, muÅ¿t put themÅ¿elves upon the reÅ¿t, and be received by conÅ¿ent, for the Church is ChriÅ¿ts kingdom; now the matter or Å¿ubjects of ChriÅ¿ts kingdom, they are believers gathered out of the world, by the preaching of the GoÅ¿pel, and the powerful MiniÅ¿try of the Spirit, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 44. hence it is that the Church in Scripture are frequently called Saints, and holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, the houÅ¿e of God, and Temple of the holy GhoÅ¿t, the houÅ¿hold of Faith, born from above, of the Spirit, that they might worÅ¿hip God in Spirit and in truth; they were darkneÅ¿s, but now are light, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 5. 8. They were loÅ¿t, but now found; were dead, but now are alive; they before had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy: were not a people, but now are a people of the living God; the Father diÅ¿dains not to count them his Å¿ons and daughters; the Son is not aÅ¿hamed to call them brethren; the Holy GhoÅ¿t is pleaÅ¿ed to make them his temple to dwell in; all which diÅ¿covers and confirms that the Church of ChriÅ¿t are and ought to be a Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual building, made up of Å¿piritual Å¿tones, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                     <p>Now if any profeÅ¿Å¿or hang back, and Å¿eek not to joyn with the Church of ChriÅ¿t, only becauÅ¿e he will not be examined before the Church, in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars before mentioned, then let me ask that man

or woman, child or Å¿ervant, how it is that you are unwilling to venture your eÅ¿tate in this world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firÅ¿t adviÅ¿ing with a Lawyer; and thou wilt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿e with PhyÅ¿itians about thy bodily health, but will adventure their Å¿ouls upon their own judgement and tryal, without taking the advice of the Church of ChriÅ¿t: is thy Å¿oul leÅ¿s precious to thee then thy body or thy eÅ¿tate? if thou haÅ¿t truth of grace, why wilt thou not bring it to the touchÅ¿tone, and come to examination? if no grace, why wilt thou refuÅ¿e the way and means to get it? Å¿urely thou doÅ¿t neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this way either,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Our of ignorance and pride, becauÅ¿e thou wilt not have thy ignorance diÅ¿covered.</p>

                     <p>4. The Church being thus planted, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof increaÅ¿ed. If you find Å¿ome qualified, you ought to proceed to elect your Officers, the Church being a moÅ¿t free Corporation under ChriÅ¿t the Lord, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2. 19. She is in all reaÅ¿on and equity to chuÅ¿e her Officers and MiniÅ¿ters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27, 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Unto whom alÅ¿o Å¿he is to give aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, obedience, and maintainance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7, 9. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                     <p>Now that theÅ¿e Officers of the Church appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ChriÅ¿t, are to have their outward calling from the Church, whereof they are members, for the preÅ¿ent, and unto whom they are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minÅ¿ter, will fully appear by theÅ¿e few reaÅ¿ons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. BecauÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tles, who taught only

AlÅ¿o, it binds the people to greater love, and obedience to him or them, whom themÅ¿elves have made choice of. But if any of the officers Å¿o elected by the Church be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in his place, he is by the Church to be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take heed to his MiniÅ¿try he hath received, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 17. to fulfil it; which if he neglect to do, by the Å¿ame power which Å¿et him up, he is to be put down and depoÅ¿ed.</p>
                     <p>Now if any ask how many are the officers or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Church?

                     <p>All theÅ¿e are uÅ¿eful and neceÅ¿Å¿ary, and theÅ¿e alone Å¿ufficient for the Church, as being the moÅ¿t perfect Å¿ociety, and body of ChriÅ¿t, which neither faileth in that which is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in any thing Å¿uperfluous; Å¿o they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and compacted together by that one Spirit, to the Lord, and each to other to the edifying of its Å¿elf in love, <hi>EpheÅ¿ians</hi> 4. 3, 4. and 16.

                     <p>2. But then in the next place for thoÅ¿e that are united to a Church of ChriÅ¿t, let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that they forÅ¿ake not the aÅ¿Å¿embling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves together, as the manner of Å¿ome is, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10. 25. And again, conÅ¿ider the danger of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10. 38. Now if any man draw back, my Å¿oul Å¿hall have no pleaÅ¿ure in him: Again, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 62. And JeÅ¿us Å¿aid unto him, no man having put his hand to the plough, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, is fit for the kingdom of God. Surely thoÅ¿e that fall off from a true Church of ChriÅ¿t, and perÅ¿evere therein to the end, Å¿hall hear ChriÅ¿t Å¿ay to them, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. <hi>But thoÅ¿e mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which would not that I Å¿hould reign over them, bring them hither, and Å¿lay them before me.</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:170103:118"/>
How dreadful is this Å¿in of falling off! FirÅ¿t, it is Å¿harply threatned of God, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 14. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38, 39. Secondly, this Å¿in is Å¿everely plagued, <hi>Matthew</hi> 12. 43, 44, 45. compared with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22.</p>
                     <p>Again, See 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifeÅ¿t, that they were not all of us:</hi> TheÅ¿e were once in the Church, but never truly of the Church; for then they would have perÅ¿evered; their apoÅ¿tacy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth evidence their hypocriÅ¿ie; falÅ¿e rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten profeÅ¿Å¿ors, will, and in all ages hath thus apoÅ¿tatized.

                     <p>THat preaching and propheÅ¿ying is a Å¿tanding Ordinance of God, will at large appear, if we conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e and the like Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 2.

And he Å¿aid unto them, go into all the world and preach the GoÅ¿pel to every creature, he that believeth and is baptized Å¿hall be Å¿aved.</hi> The buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of preaching is to make new creatures, and to turn Lions into Lambs; the Preacher is but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trument in the hand of God, to make an unbeliever to believe he is Gods workmanÅ¿hip, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2. 10. An ax makes no Artificial thing, but by influence from the Artificer; neither doth a pen write, but by his help that handles it. So Preachers and preaching, is but inÅ¿trumental in the hand of the Spirit, to make you ChriÅ¿ts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2. They may be only called MiniÅ¿ters, by whom the people believe, God was mighty by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. 8. MiniÅ¿ters are

                     <p>A MiniÅ¿ter of the GoÅ¿pel is duly to divide and diÅ¿tribute the word according to every ones Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eÅ¿tate and condition; they muÅ¿t Å¿peak comfort, to whom comfort belongs, and counÅ¿el to whom counÅ¿el belongs, and reproof to whom reproof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and terror to whom terror belongs, 2 <hi>Timothy 2. 15.

                     <p>Again, ChriÅ¿t is to be preached, becauÅ¿e this is the only way to Å¿ave and win Å¿ouls to JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12. compared with <hi>John 17. 3. Acts</hi> 2. 14 to 42.</p>
                     <p>If any ask further what a MiniÅ¿ter is to preach? Then I anÅ¿wer, he is to preach the GoÅ¿pel, and he is to preach the Law, for Å¿o did ChriÅ¿t and his ApoÅ¿tles: but the GoÅ¿pel is to be preached chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and mainly, but the Law accidentally and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ionally, as will more fully appear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>

And in another place they are called the MiniÅ¿ters of ChriÅ¿t, and of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they did preach the GoÅ¿pel in the firÅ¿t place.

                     <p>2. In the Elocution there are two extremities to be avoided.</p>

                     <p>AS the miniÅ¿try of the GoÅ¿pel is an ordinance of God: So hath the Å¿ame God ordained that they that preach the GoÅ¿pel Å¿hould live of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
                     <p>Again we read <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. that it is the duty of the people Å¿o to do, <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things,</hi> Luke 10. 7. <hi>for the labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 8. <hi>I robbed other Churches, taking wages of them to do you Å¿ervice;</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 9. <hi>For it is written in the Law of</hi> MoÅ¿es, <hi>thou Å¿halt not muzzle the mouth of the ox, that treadeth out the Corn:</hi> doth God take care for oxen, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Or Å¿aith he it altogether for our Å¿akes? for our Å¿akes no doubt this is written, <hi>ver. 11. if we have Å¿own unto you Å¿piritual things, is it a great thing if we Å¿hall reap your carnal things?</hi>

                     <p>But withall take theÅ¿e cautions? a GoÅ¿pel mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by the Lord appointed, is for none but a GoÅ¿pel MiniÅ¿try, plants of his own planting, the other plants are to be pluckt up: then alÅ¿o this maintenance muÅ¿t be collected in a GoÅ¿pel way, not by Tythes, and commencing Å¿uits at Law, and taking away their goods by violence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Prayer is a Å¿peaking to God face to face, wherein we Å¿peak to him in Faith, Humility, Sincerity and Fervencie of Spirit; it is <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, by which a Å¿oul climbs up to Heaven, and it is <hi>Noahs</hi> dove that goeth forth and returns not till it brings an anÅ¿wer of peace. Or prayer is a calling upon God alone in the name of ChriÅ¿t by the help of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, or it is the earneÅ¿t requeÅ¿t of an humble and Å¿anctified Heart, together with thankÅ¿giving, in behalf of our Å¿elves and others, with aÅ¿Å¿urance to be heard in what
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170103:131"/>
we pray for, according to the will of God, <hi>Phil. 4. 6. Rom. 8. 26. PÅ¿al. 50. 15. Eph. 6. 18. 1 John 5. 14. James</hi> 1. 6. Or Prayer is a Familiar Å¿peech with God in the name of ChriÅ¿t, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 14. Opening the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ires of our hearts unto him, and a pouring out of the heart before him for the things we need, <hi>PÅ¿al. 50. 15. Jer. 33. 3. Lam.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>Or prayer is a Å¿piritual gift and grace of the holy GhoÅ¿t, teaching us both what to pray for, and how to pray, enabling us to pour out our Å¿ouls unto the Lord with Å¿ighs that cannot be uttered, <hi>PÅ¿al. 62. 8. Rom. 8. 26. PÅ¿alm</hi> 145. 18. the Lord is nigh to all them that call upon him in truth: Heart and tongue muÅ¿t go together, word and work, lip and life, prayer and practice muÅ¿t eccho one to the other: it is not the greatneÅ¿s of the voice, nor the multitude of words, nor the Å¿weetneÅ¿s of the tone, nor the Å¿tudied notions, nor the Eloquent expreÅ¿Å¿ions, but truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, that is prevalent with God: now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of effectual prayer are theÅ¿e.</p>

                     <head>What extraordinary prayer is.</head>
                     <p>EXtraordinary prayer is that which is made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿ome Å¿pecial occaÅ¿ion, or extraordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident falling out, felt or feared, upon a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, City, Family, or PerÅ¿on; by reaÅ¿on whereof our prayers are both longer, and ferventer then at other times, <hi>PÅ¿alm 119. 62. Acts 12. 5. Joel 2. 15. Ionah</hi> 3. 6. See <hi>Ezra 9. Dan.</hi> 9. and <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. In theÅ¿e times of FaÅ¿ting, or extraordinary praying, or both, we are moÅ¿t earneÅ¿tly and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently to call upon God either for the obtaining of Å¿ome Å¿ingular benefit, or Å¿pecial favour that we Å¿tand in great need of, or for the avoiding of Å¿ome Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial puniÅ¿hment, or notable judgement hanging over our heads, or already fallen upon us, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31, 32. and 14. 23. 2. <hi>Chron 20. Ioel</hi> 1. 2, 12. 16.</p>
                     <p>There are three things to be conÅ¿idered about this extraordinary prayer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is Å¿omething to be conÅ¿idered before we enter upon it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is Å¿omething to be conÅ¿idered in this prayer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is Å¿omething to be conÅ¿idered after this prayer.</p>
                     <p>1. Something to be conÅ¿idered before this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary prayer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What our wants are, either for Å¿oul or body, our Å¿elves or others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What promiÅ¿es we have from God, that he will give us Å¿uch things.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That we agree together, to pray for theÅ¿e
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170103:133"/>
things, with one tongue and one heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let us alÅ¿o for the keeping up our Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider what wonderful things prayer hath done; it hath healed the Å¿ick, and raiÅ¿ed the dead, unlooÅ¿ed chains, and unlocked priÅ¿ons, and Å¿et the Saints free, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 5, 7, 11.</p>
                     <p>2. There are Å¿ome things to be conÅ¿idered in prayer, and they are four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That we call upon God in truth of heart, <hi>PÅ¿al. 145. 18. PÅ¿al.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beware of drilling out too much time in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; long prayers oftentimes deaden others affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: it is good to pray brief and often, as ChriÅ¿t did, <hi>Matthew</hi> 26. 39, 42, 44. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When we pray to one in the Trinity, let us mind all three, Father, Son, and Holy GhoÅ¿t, and Å¿ever them not.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let us be very importunate, and earneÅ¿t, and Å¿ervent; and that we may do Å¿o, conÅ¿ider the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the things we ask, and the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of them, <hi>Rom. 15. 30. PÅ¿al.</hi> 143. 6. ConÅ¿ider, how did <hi>Daniel</hi> pray in the Lions den, the three children in the fiery furnace, <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Whales belly, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the dungeon, and our Saviour ChriÅ¿t, when he prayed, and Å¿weat drops of blood? let us endeavour to pray Å¿o, that he may turn our darkneÅ¿s into light, our deadneÅ¿s into life, our bondage into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and our weakneÅ¿s into Å¿trength.</p>
                     <p>3. And laÅ¿tly, there be four things to be conÅ¿idered after prayer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. PreÅ¿s after what we have prayed for, in the uÅ¿e
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170103:134"/>
of all the means for the accompliÅ¿hing or obtaining of thoÅ¿e things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 2, 4, 5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hearken and liÅ¿ten what the Lord doth Å¿ay, as a man that doth knock at a great mans door, he liÅ¿tneth to hear if any body be coming, if not, he knocks again and again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Expect and wait patiently for a full anÅ¿wer, <hi>PÅ¿al. 40. 1. I waited patiently for the Lord, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto me, and heard my cry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Learn wiÅ¿ely to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h between delayes and denials, and not take a delay for a denial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 21. to 29. ChriÅ¿t did delay the woman pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, but not deny her, and at laÅ¿t did give her more then Å¿he had asked. Surely, as prayer is the cry of our hearts, to open all our neceÅ¿Å¿ities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 19. So it is alÅ¿o the key of the Lords treaÅ¿ury, and to obtain the mercies from him that we need; Å¿o we pray in the name of the Son, by the help of the Spirit according to his will, with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding, reverence, humility and fervency, faith, love, and perÅ¿everance.</p>

as appears, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36. 37. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
                     <p>Prayer is a means to recover our peace, and to nouriÅ¿h our communion with our God, <hi>Dan. 9. Phil. 4. 6, 7. John</hi> 17. Surely, Å¿uch as have leaÅ¿t care, and make leaÅ¿t conÅ¿cience of calling upon God, have leaÅ¿t acquaintance and acceptance with him, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
                     <p>Prayer is a Key to open the Å¿torehouÅ¿es of all Gods treaÅ¿ury unto us; as by knocking we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the place we deÅ¿ire to go unto; Å¿o by prayer we obtain thoÅ¿e things we need: prayer is as a hook to reach thoÅ¿e things that are above our reach, and to put by thoÅ¿e things that Å¿tand in our way; in a word, it is Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary, as without it, the uÅ¿e and the enjoyment of the things we have is unlawful, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. For as if we take any thing that is our neighbours, without asking him leave, we are accounted thieves. So to take any thing of Gods (whoÅ¿e all things are) without asking them at his hand, is felony, <hi>Ier. 10. 25.

                     <p>PRayer is a jewel of grace bequeathed by ChriÅ¿t unto us, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. Again, it is the hand of Faith, the Key of Gods treaÅ¿ury, the Å¿ouls So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor, the hearts armour-bearer, the minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, <hi>Mat. 7. 7. EpheÅ¿.</hi> 6. 18. It procureth all bleÅ¿Å¿ings, preventeth all curÅ¿es, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14. Further, it Å¿anctifieth all creatures that they may do us good, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. Å¿eaÅ¿oneth all croÅ¿Å¿es, that they can do us no hurt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 18. LaÅ¿tly, it keepeth the heart in humility, the life in Å¿obriety; Å¿trengthneth all graces, overcometh all corruptions, Å¿ubdueth all temptations, maketh our duties accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, our lives profitable unto men, and both life and death comfortable to our Å¿elves, <hi>Act. 9. 11. EpheÅ¿. 6. 18. Iude 20. Acts</hi> 4. 24. What Å¿hall I Å¿ay more for our encouragement to pray unto God but only this? conÅ¿ider, and that Å¿eriouÅ¿ly, the Lord is never worÅ¿e, but many times better then his word. <hi>Solomon</hi> did only ask in prayer for wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 1 <hi>King. 3. 11, 12. And the Lord gave him more wiÅ¿dom then he did ask and riches and honour to boot.</hi> Again, we read, 1 <hi>Sam. 1.

                     <p>So again, for our encouragement to pray, we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. That <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed, Å¿aying, <hi>Oh that IÅ¿hmael might live before thee, ver.</hi> 19. And God Å¿aid, <hi>Sarah thy wife Å¿hall bear thee a Å¿on indeed,

                     <p>Again, we read that <hi>Jacob</hi> prayed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 19. and Å¿aid, <hi>O Lord, if thou wilt give me raiment to put on, and bread to eat, thou Å¿halt be my God; and the Lord gave him all that he deÅ¿ired, and much more, Gen. 32. 10. For with my Å¿taff,</hi> Å¿aid he, <hi>came I over this Jordan, but now I am Å¿o exceedingly encreaÅ¿ed in goods, that I am become two bands.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>Again, we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 24, 26. Of one that was in debt ten thouÅ¿and talents; and the mony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded, the debtor deÅ¿ired but dayes of pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Lord forgave him the whole debt, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.</p>

                  <p>That it ought to be practiÅ¿ed by every believer, as occaÅ¿ion requires, and as the Spirit is drawn forth thereunto, is very evident from <hi>Jam. 5. 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>That the PÅ¿alms of <hi>David</hi> ought to be Å¿ung, will appear by theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. BecauÅ¿e I find no other PÅ¿alms mentioned in the Scriptures, then the PÅ¿alms of <hi>David,</hi> and Å¿uch as are contained in that book of PÅ¿alms.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

Luke 24. 44. Acts 1. 20. Acts</hi> 13. 33, 35.</p>

                  <p>That our Singing ought to be performed with a cheerfull heart, and that they only ought to Å¿ing whoÅ¿e hearts the Lord hath made glad, the Scriptures do evidently declare: Its Å¿aid in 2 <hi>Chron 29. 30.

                  <p>That our Å¿inging ought to be with grace in the heart, is evident from <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. that is I conceive either with a heart full of the Å¿enÅ¿e of Gods pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and juÅ¿tifying grace, or as it is regenerated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and Sanctified by the Å¿pirit of grace; this is the root of all true Spiritual and heavenly rejoycing, and this hath made the Saints to Å¿ing aloud for joy, <hi>PÅ¿al. 71. 23. my lips Å¿hall greatly rejoyce, when I Å¿ing unto thee, PÅ¿al. 145. 7.

                  <p>Some objections I have met with, as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the performance of this duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But if it be granted that PÅ¿alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be Å¿ung, what warrant have we to Å¿ing them in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? and if you have no warrant in the word for Å¿uch a practiÅ¿e, then is it a meer tradition and invention of men: nothing ought to be practiÅ¿ed in the worÅ¿hip of God, but what is warranted by the word of God.</p>

If we are offended with meeter, becauÅ¿e there will be Å¿ome variation, or change of words from what they are in the PÅ¿alms, upon record, though they agree never Å¿o much with the Å¿enÅ¿e of the Spirit of God in them, then may we alÅ¿o be offended with our Bibles, and lay them aÅ¿ide, becauÅ¿e one Bible differs from another very much in the tranÅ¿lation, as we may find if we compare one reading with another; and yet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed and conÅ¿idered, the Å¿enÅ¿e is the Å¿ame, and the mind of the Holy-GhoÅ¿t may be underÅ¿tood in either.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Water is copious and plentiful, there is no leÅ¿s in the river for thy drinking, there is enough for all men. So is the blood of ChriÅ¿t, it can never be drawn dry of his fulneÅ¿s. we may all receive, yet he never the more empty, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Water is a cleanÅ¿ing and purifying element, and it reÅ¿embles the blood of ChriÅ¿t fitly in that, 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 7. The blood of ChriÅ¿t cleanÅ¿eth from us all Å¿in.</hi>

                  <p>The inward thing Å¿ignified, is many times really exhibited, and coveyed and Å¿ealed in the uÅ¿e of the outward: hence are thoÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions in Scripture, of being born again of water, and of the Holy GhoÅ¿t, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. of cleanÅ¿ing by the waÅ¿hing of water, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 5. 29. So again, <hi>ariÅ¿e and be baptized, and waÅ¿h away thy Å¿ins, Acts</hi> 22. 16.

                  <p>We Å¿hould know that confirming Ordinances, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170103:143"/>
or Å¿eals, properly do not give us any right unto God and his ChriÅ¿t, and promiÅ¿es, but only Å¿eal up and confirm that right and intereÅ¿t which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready we have in Gods Covenant of Grace: God promiÅ¿ed to Father <hi>Adam</hi> life, and then he gave him the tree of life, to be a pledge of his promiÅ¿e: now it was not the tree of life, that gave <hi>Adam</hi> life, but God according to his promiÅ¿e. <hi>Adam</hi> might have lived upon God in the promiÅ¿e without the tree, for the tree could do him no good without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e. Thus God promiÅ¿ed ChriÅ¿t, and his benefits to the believing generation, and then he gave Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿m to Å¿eal theÅ¿e promiÅ¿es. So then it is not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿m that Å¿aves us, but the promiÅ¿es; it is not water that purgeth our Å¿ins, but the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; what Å¿hall I Å¿ay more? where God is pleaÅ¿ed to diÅ¿penÅ¿e his Å¿eals they are great comforts, and pledges of his love, and where he denieth means and oportunity of enjoying the Å¿igns, the things Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified are never the further off, or leÅ¿s effectual: <hi>Davids</hi> child died the Å¿eventh day, a day before the time appointed for circumciÅ¿ion: and yet both his words and his carriage gives us to underÅ¿tand that he doubted not of the Å¿alvation of it. So the thief upon the croÅ¿s, believing in ChriÅ¿t, was received with ChriÅ¿t into ParadiÅ¿e, though he were never baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but he had the inward grace of baptiÅ¿m, the waÅ¿hing of the blood of ChriÅ¿t, though not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Å¿ign; Å¿ome have the outward Å¿ign, and not the inward grace, Å¿ome have the inward grace, and not the outward Å¿ign: when God affordeth means, we muÅ¿t wait upon him for a bleÅ¿Å¿ing in them, and by them, as his pipes of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170103:144"/>
and when he doth not afford means, we Å¿hould not tye the working of his grace to them.</p>
                  <p>TheÅ¿e things Å¿eriouÅ¿ly conÅ¿idered, may make any man admire why there Å¿hould be Å¿o great contention, jarring, and wrangling about the time when, and the perÅ¿ons to whom, and the manner how this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is to be adminiÅ¿tred: are not the Scriptures as clear in laying down this, as they are in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ordinance it Å¿elf? now the Scripture being the rule, we are to look for a precept for what we do, otherwiÅ¿e the Lord will Å¿ay, who hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theÅ¿e things at your hands? and in the want of a precept, we are to walk by example, Å¿o Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, ye ought Å¿o to walk as ye have us for an example: in the want of a precept and example, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary directions, inferences and conÅ¿equences may be made uÅ¿e of, as I might prove at large; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of drawing any of theÅ¿e againÅ¿t a plain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and example. Now give me leave to preÅ¿ent a few of thoÅ¿e precepts and examples, recorded in the Scripture, for the baptizing of a believer, and when the reader hath anÅ¿wered theÅ¿e few, I Å¿hall give him Å¿o many more for ought I know.</p>
                  <p>1. For precept, conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e three Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. Then <hi>Peter</hi> Å¿aid unto them, <hi>repent and be baptized every one of you,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 10. 48. <hi>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.</hi> Acts 22. 16. <hi>And now why tarrieÅ¿t thou, ariÅ¿e and be baptized, and waÅ¿h away thy Å¿ins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now here being three precepts for the baptizing of believers, <hi>can any man forbid water, that theÅ¿e Å¿hould not be baptized, which have received the Holy GhoÅ¿t as well as we?</hi> Acts 10. 47.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:170103:144"/>2. For example, conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e three examples, <hi>Mat. 3. 13, 14, 15. Then cometh JeÅ¿us to John to be baptized, ver. 16. and JeÅ¿us when he was baptized, went up Å¿traight way out of the water, and loe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were opened unto him,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 2. 41. <hi>Then they that gladly received the word, were baptized,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 8. 12. <hi>They were baptized both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Behold, here is both precept and example for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of believers, and that in the mouth of two or three witneÅ¿Å¿es (and yet Å¿hall not every word be eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed?) Shew me the like for baptizing of children, and I will write a book of recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and acknowledge my error both to God and man: But I am Å¿ure thou canÅ¿t not do it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thou wilt make a new Scripture, or groÅ¿ly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this.</p>
                  <p>Let the Reader beware at laÅ¿t, that he be not found amongÅ¿t the number of thoÅ¿e Å¿poken of, <hi>Luk. 7. 30. But the PhariÅ¿ees and Lawyers rejected the counÅ¿el of God againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, being not bapeized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That BaptiÅ¿m is an Ordinance of the GoÅ¿pel, and that only believers hath right unto it, hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: now I Å¿hall lay down a few reaÅ¿ons why chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought not to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>1. BecauÅ¿e we find no command nor example in the word of God, that any Infants were baptized, and we are forbidden to preÅ¿ume above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and further, if we Å¿hould admit of any one thing in the worÅ¿hip of God, which we find no warrant for in the word of God, we Å¿hould be forced by the Å¿ame reaÅ¿on to admit of many, yea of any inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. To exerciÅ¿e Faith in the blood of ChriÅ¿t for the waÅ¿hing away of Å¿ins, See <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Acts 22. 16. AriÅ¿e and be baptized, and waÅ¿h away thy Å¿ins, calling on the name of the Lord</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Special things held forth in this Ordinance, that a child is not capable of diÅ¿cerning, is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tical mortification of Å¿in, <hi>Rom. 6. 3. Know you not that Å¿o many of us that were baptized into JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, were baptized into his death, ver. 6. knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of Å¿in might be deÅ¿troyed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another thing held forth to us in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is the riÅ¿ing again unto newneÅ¿s of life, <hi>Romans 6 4. Therefore we are buried with him by EaptiÅ¿m, verÅ¿e 5. For if we have been plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the likeneÅ¿s of his death, we Å¿hall be raiÅ¿ed in the likeneÅ¿s of his reÅ¿urrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another thing held forth in this Ordinance, is the BaptiÅ¿m of the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another thing held forth in this bleÅ¿Å¿ed Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is the reÅ¿urrection of the body, See <hi>Col. 7. 12. Rom.</hi> 6. 5, 8.</p>
                  <p>I Å¿uppoÅ¿e the Reader will grant that a child is not capable of apprehending, believing and applying
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170103:145"/>
theÅ¿e and the like things held forth in this Ordinance, and that God requires that Å¿uch as are baptized, Å¿hould firÅ¿t believe, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Act. 8. 12, 13, 36, 37, 38. Mat. 3. 6. Act.</hi> 10. 47, 48.</p>
                  <p>But becauÅ¿e this controverÅ¿ie is handled at large in other treatiÅ¿es, Å¿uch as deÅ¿ire further Å¿atisfaction may have recourÅ¿e to them.</p>
                  <p>Now, what art thou doing O man that calleÅ¿t me and others AnabaptiÅ¿ts? for our obedience to God in this bleÅ¿Å¿ed Ordinance, whileÅ¿t thou art rejecting his counÅ¿el? if thou Å¿ay, was not I baptized hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? I anÅ¿wer, if I were baptized with God-fathers and God-mothers, Common prayer book, CroÅ¿s and SurpliÅ¿s, and by a MiniÅ¿ter made by the BiÅ¿hops, all which are voted down, as AntichriÅ¿tian, and the manner of that BaptiÅ¿m was alÅ¿o by Å¿prinkling water upon my face, concerning which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Å¿ilent, how may I be aÅ¿Å¿ured God will own Å¿uch a BaptiÅ¿m for his Ordinance? Blame me not then if I endeavour to follow ChriÅ¿t herein, who was baptized when he came to years, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me Å¿o to walk, as I have him for an example, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15, 16. I Å¿hall cloÅ¿e up all that I have to Å¿ay at this time to this Ordinance with two words of advice, the one to thoÅ¿e that own BaptiÅ¿m according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rule, when people are capable of it; the other to thoÅ¿e that rail, mock, and deride the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are baptized, calling them AnabaptiÅ¿ts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You that have taken up this Ordinance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of laying a greater Å¿treÅ¿s upon it, then ever God appointed you, <hi>viz.</hi> it was never appointed to break love, and Communion, and to quench the Spirit,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170103:146"/>
and to juÅ¿tle out Å¿ome other Ordinances, nor to Å¿hut out the weak in the Faith, nor to put them upon doubtful diÅ¿putations; my brethren, let me tell you, I have rather choÅ¿en to weep it out before the Lord in my cloÅ¿Å¿et, then to publiÅ¿h to the world<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> what I have heard and Å¿een amongÅ¿t you; what? know you not that all ChriÅ¿tians are one in ChriÅ¿t, and partakers of one Spirit, promiÅ¿es, graces, and have right to all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges? what? know you not that all Saints are fellow-members, fellow-Å¿ouldiers, fellow-travellers, co-heirs, fellow-Å¿ufferers, and fellow-Citizens, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Å¿ame father, being cloathed with the Å¿ame robe, ruled by the Å¿ame word, inclined to the Å¿ame work? will you Å¿hut out thoÅ¿e that God hath received, and Å¿top the mouth that God hath opened, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿e communion with thoÅ¿e that have fellowÅ¿hip with the Father, and the Son, and that are faithful to what they know? are all blind that doth not Å¿ee by your eyes?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You that Å¿o exceedingly cry up BaptiÅ¿m of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and cry down all baptizing of believers. Let me tell you, that through prejudice, weakneÅ¿s and blindneÅ¿s, you cry up that which you have neither precept nor example for in all the book of God, and cry down that which there is precept upon precept for, and example upon example: I even tremble to think what a Å¿ad account you will give to God for this one day: if you Å¿ay you can prove the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿m of Infants by neceÅ¿Å¿ary Deductions from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Inferences, and ConÅ¿equences, then let me ask you how you durÅ¿t to make uÅ¿e of any of theÅ¿e to croÅ¿s plain precepts and examples.</p>

                  <p>ASSurance is a certain Å¿weet motion of the Å¿oul Å¿teadily reÅ¿ting upon the mercy of God, through the merits of ChriÅ¿t, with an unÅ¿haken expectation of all that is promiÅ¿ed; this aÅ¿Å¿urance in Scripture hath Å¿everal denominations, which I Å¿hall Å¿peak to under the next head.</p>
                  <p>Or aÅ¿Å¿urance is a victorious concluÅ¿ion againÅ¿t the Å¿trength of doubting, whereby the mind of a believer is certained and perÅ¿waded, and upon good grounds Å¿etled concerning his perÅ¿onal intereÅ¿t in ChriÅ¿t and all his benefits.</p>
                  <p>AÅ¿Å¿urance conquers our doubtings, anÅ¿wers our arguments, clears our evidences unto the Å¿oul, againÅ¿t the many Å¿uÅ¿pitions which did ariÅ¿e, that ChriÅ¿t doth indeed own it, that he is the Saviour thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>LET us conÅ¿ider, that there is a great deal of counterfeit knowledge, and counterfeit faith, and counterfeit love, and counterfeit repentance: Å¿o there is a great deal of counterfeit aÅ¿Å¿urance in the world; many there be that talk high, and look big, and bear it out bravely, whereas when their aÅ¿Å¿urance comes to be weighed in the ballance, and brought to the teÅ¿t, it will be found too light; when it cometh to withÅ¿tand temptation, it is found too weak, and when it Å¿hould put the Å¿oul upon Divine action, it is found to be but a lazy preÅ¿umption; Å¿o we are apt to think our Å¿ins to be no Å¿ins, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they be many, and that they are but Å¿mal, when indeed they are great, and that we have grace, when we have none, and that our grace is true, when it is counterfeit, and that our condition is not Å¿o bad as others, when it is worÅ¿e: Å¿o we are apt to lay claim to God, to ChriÅ¿t, and the promiÅ¿es, and priviledges, and all the glory of another world, when we are in the Å¿ight of God, poor, and blind, and miÅ¿erable, and naked, being ChriÅ¿tleÅ¿s, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s, and truthleÅ¿s, and Å¿o think our Å¿elves to be Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when we are nothing according to this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
                  <p>AÅ¿Å¿urance is not all kind of perÅ¿waÅ¿ion, there are two kinds of aÅ¿Å¿urance or perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of the mind touching a mans perÅ¿onal intereÅ¿t in ChriÅ¿t, one is imaginary and deluding, for as the heart of a man
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170103:164"/>
may deceive it Å¿elf, about the habit of Faith, or any other grace, Å¿o it may delude a man about the acts and degrees of the Å¿ame; doth the true believer believe in ChriÅ¿t? Å¿o thinks the hypocrite that he doth too: hath a true believer a perÅ¿waÅ¿ion of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t in ChriÅ¿t? Å¿o hath the hypocrite to a moÅ¿t exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confidence, an Iron faith that will never doubt nor bow; it is juÅ¿t with him as with a poor man in a dream, what the rich man hath by propriety, that Å¿ame thing may the pooreÅ¿t man have in a dream, fancy or imagination.</p>

                  <head>Many reaÅ¿ons wherefore the Lord doth not give aÅ¿Å¿urance Å¿peedily.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BEcauÅ¿e aÅ¿Å¿urance is meat for Å¿trong men, babes are not able to bear it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿t it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He doth not give it Å¿peedily, becauÅ¿e we are apt to Å¿eek it more for our Å¿elves, then we do for his honour; as the Sun doth, as it were, put out the light of the Moon, Å¿tars, fire and candle. So the glory of God muÅ¿t put out all other ends; the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that minds his wages more then his work, muÅ¿t not wonder if his maÅ¿ter be Å¿lack in paying him; and Å¿ure it is, that he that is moÅ¿t mindfull of Gods honour, God will be moÅ¿t mindfull of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another reaÅ¿on why he doth not Å¿peedily give in aÅ¿Å¿urance is, that when they have it they may the more highly prize it, and the more carefully keep it, and the more wiÅ¿ely improve it, and the more
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170103:164"/>
affectionately and effectually bleÅ¿s God for it; none Å¿ets Å¿uch a prize upon light, as he that hath lain a long time in darkneÅ¿s.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we might live purely upon ChriÅ¿t, we are apt to reÅ¿t upon every thing below ChriÅ¿t, <hi>viz.</hi> to reÅ¿t upon creatures, to reÅ¿t upon gifts or graces, duties and Divine manifeÅ¿tations, or celeÅ¿tial conÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and to reÅ¿t upon gracious evidences: now the Lord to cure his people of theÅ¿e diÅ¿tempers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times leaves his children of light to walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s; but let us conÅ¿ider, that although the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of aÅ¿Å¿urance doth make moÅ¿t for our comfort, as we have Å¿aid before: yet the living purely upon ChriÅ¿t in the want of aÅ¿Å¿urance, doth make moÅ¿t for his glory; no ChriÅ¿tian to him that in the want of viÅ¿ibles, can live upon an inviÅ¿ible God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord moÅ¿t times will have his people make a conÅ¿tant progreÅ¿s in holineÅ¿s before he gives them this happineÅ¿s of aÅ¿Å¿urance, for aÅ¿Å¿urance in a Å¿enÅ¿e is the daughter of holineÅ¿s.</p>

Gal. 3. 10. James</hi> 2. 10. So that the breach thereof even once, and in the leaÅ¿t point, maketh us debtors preÅ¿ently (as having forfeited our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) So that no man can make amends unto God for it, conÅ¿idering that whatÅ¿oever he doth after the breach, is both imperfectly done, and if it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet it is due by obligation of the Law, and therefore cannot go for payment, no more then a man can pay one debt with another.</p>
               <p>6. The Å¿ixt and laÅ¿t petition: And lead us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation but delievers from evil.</p>
               <p>In this petition we pray, that not only our Å¿in may be pardoned, but alÅ¿o that it may be mortified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1, 2. and that we may be either kept from temptation, or preÅ¿erved by his grace from being hurt thereby, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 9. The effect of temptation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Å¿pecial grace of God, is extreamly evil,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170103:172"/>
to wit Å¿in and damnation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p>Now Å¿eeing we cannot be tempted without the will of God, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 10. nor reÅ¿iÅ¿t without his power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. If it be his bleÅ¿Å¿ed will, that he would not let us fall into the one, unleÅ¿s he preÅ¿erve us in the other, and that he would tie up Satan, and reÅ¿train his malice and power, or elÅ¿e make us wiÅ¿e to know and avoid his Å¿tratagems.</p>

                  <p>Therefore let us not yield to Satans temptations, who hath the worÅ¿t name, and the worÅ¿t nature of all created creatures: our carnal Å¿ecurity is his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and he that would not be taken with Satans deviÅ¿es, let him make preÅ¿ent reÅ¿iÅ¿tance againÅ¿t Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans firÅ¿t motions.</p>

                  <head>Of aÅ¿Å¿urance of Salvation, in Sentences.</head>
                  <p>A SÅ¿urance is a Å¿alve for every Å¿ore, and a remedy for every malady; a ChriÅ¿tians anchor at Å¿ea, and his Å¿hield at land, a Å¿taff to Å¿upport him, a Å¿word to defend him, and a pavilion to hide him.</p>
                  <p>AÅ¿Å¿urance makes heavy afflictions light, and long afflictions Å¿hort, and bitter afflictions Å¿weet; God hath made an everlaÅ¿ting Å¿eparation between Å¿in and peace, Å¿in and joy, Å¿in and aÅ¿Å¿urance; if Å¿in and our Å¿ouls be one, God and our Å¿ouls muÅ¿t needs be two.</p>
                  <p>He that will get aÅ¿Å¿urance, muÅ¿t mind his work more then his wages, for aÅ¿Å¿urance is heavenlywages,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170103:188"/>
that God gives not to loiterers, but to the ingenious labourers.</p>
                  <p>Though no man merits aÅ¿Å¿urance by his obedience, yet God uÅ¿ually crowns obedience with aÅ¿Å¿urance.</p>
                  <p>That Å¿oul will never attain to any Å¿ettled aÅ¿Å¿urance of Salvation, that builds his hopes upon a Å¿andy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; We cannot diÅ¿truÅ¿t our Å¿elves too much, nor truÅ¿t ChriÅ¿t too much.</p>
                  <p>It is one thing for God to love a Å¿oul, and another thing for God to aÅ¿Å¿ure that Å¿oul of his love.</p>
                  <p>A man may be truly holy, and yet not have aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he Å¿hall be eternally happy.</p>
                  <p>God writes many a mans name in the book of life, and yet not let him have aÅ¿Å¿urance of it till the hour of death; aÅ¿Å¿urance is a mercy too good for moÅ¿t mens hearts, a crown too weighty for moÅ¿t mens heads. It is the beÅ¿t and greateÅ¿t mercy, and therefore God will only give it to his neareÅ¿t and deareÅ¿t friends. As faith is often attended with unbelief, and Å¿incerity with hypocriÅ¿ie, and humility with vain glory, Å¿o is aÅ¿Å¿urance with fears and doubts.</p>

                  <p>And Å¿o it came to be called the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> BecauÅ¿e the Å¿pecial dedication thereof was to the Lords Å¿ervice.</p>
                  <p>So then this day was changed from the Å¿eventh to the firÅ¿t, and from a Sabbath to a firÅ¿t or Lords day, becauÅ¿e it might Å¿erve for a thankful memorial of ChriÅ¿ts reÅ¿urrection: for as God reÅ¿ted from his Labour on the laÅ¿t day of the week, Å¿o ChriÅ¿t ceaÅ¿ed from his labour and afflictions on this day, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 1. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 2.

                  <p>So then the Å¿ourth Commandment doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Å¿eventh day from the Creation, but a Å¿eventh day in general: Å¿o then it doth not hence follow that we Å¿hould reÅ¿t the Å¿ame day the Lrod reÅ¿ted, but that we Å¿hould reÅ¿t from our works one day in Å¿even, as he reÅ¿ted from his; which day under the Law he appointed to be the laÅ¿t day of the week; Å¿o nothing hindereth but by his Å¿pecial appointment under the GoÅ¿pel, it may be the firÅ¿t day, and yet the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Commandment nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: if any reply and Å¿ay, why doth not the new TeÅ¿tament mention this change?

                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> It is undoubtedly the duty of a wicked man to pray, and the Priviledge of a ChriÅ¿tian that he can do it, though they that have no faith, cannot Å¿eek ChriÅ¿t as they ought; yet it is their duty to pray and to Å¿eek after ChriÅ¿t, <hi>PÅ¿al. 79. 6. Pour out thy wrath upon the Heathen that have not known thee, and upon the Kingdoms that have not called upon thy name:</hi> So again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25.

                  <p>

The Lord doth cauÅ¿e the Sun to Å¿hine, and the rain to fall upon them, therefore beware of judging and condemning them: are they proud? who can tell but God may humble them: are they unclean? who can tell but God may cleanÅ¿e them: we ought to be courteous in our behaviour towards them, <hi>Gen. 23. 7, 12. Abraham bowed himÅ¿elf to the people of the Land,</hi> ChriÅ¿t was tender hearted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, he wept over them that were to Å¿hed his blood: and we are to own and commend what there is of God in them: Å¿o it is Å¿aid, ChriÅ¿t did love the young man in the GoÅ¿pel, for thoÅ¿e natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts that there were in him. God is the fountain of common gifts, as well as of Å¿aving grace. The Lord doth make uÅ¿e of them, to bring out of their loyns many precious men: and Å¿ometimes he doth
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:170103:202"/>
make uÅ¿e of them, to help the woman, and Å¿ometimes to awaken his people, and put them upon their guard: but in all our converÅ¿ings with wicked men, take heed to theÅ¿e things. (1.) Walk warily and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿pectly before them, <hi>Phil. 2. 15. For you are in the midÅ¿t of a crooked and perverÅ¿e Nation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 12. <hi>Having therefore your converÅ¿ation honeÅ¿t amongst the Gentiles,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>For Å¿o is the will of God, that with well doing, we put to Å¿ilence the ignorance of fooliÅ¿h men.</hi> (2) Beware of envying at their proÅ¿perity, becauÅ¿e God hath prohibited that, <hi>PÅ¿alm</hi> 37. 1. ConÅ¿ider, they have their reward here in this life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 19. There is no reward to a wicked man in another life. (3.) Beware of cracking a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience to procure their favour, as <hi>Judas</hi> did: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider their favour is fickle, and it is a madneÅ¿s to loÅ¿e the favour of God, to gain the favour of his enemies. (4.) Beware of omitting thoÅ¿e duties that God requires of you for fear of them: this is to life up man more then God. ConÅ¿ider, omiÅ¿Å¿ion may damn a man, as well as commiÅ¿Å¿ions, and hereby we Å¿hall gratifie carnal men, by omitting of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for fear of them: and by this we Å¿hall Å¿tag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thoÅ¿e that were coming on in the wayes of God. (5.) Beware of too deep a familiarity with them, and that for theÅ¿e reaÅ¿ons. FirÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e they have no communion nor fellowÅ¿hip with God, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 2. 12. They are without ChriÅ¿t in the world, and have communion with Satan, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. The whole world lyeth in wickedneÅ¿s.

                     <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> I have Å¿poken to Election before in its place, but Å¿eeing here are more particulars, then there I have Å¿poken unto, I Å¿hall anÅ¿wer each briefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to election what it is? conÅ¿ider that it is a Å¿pecial decree of God, touching the conferring of eternal Å¿alvation, by ChriÅ¿t the Redeemer, to certain men of meer mercy and good will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the cauÅ¿es of election, it is the love of the Trinity, God Almighty, Father, Son and Holy GhoÅ¿t. The manner of working peculiarly to each of them: the Scripture expreÅ¿ly Å¿heweth that the Father and the Son did elect us, <hi>EpheÅ¿. 1. 4. John</hi> 15. 16. In which we may not exclude the Holy GhoÅ¿t, who
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170103:204"/>
hath one common God-head with them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. So that the cauÅ¿e which moved God to elect, was his meer good will, and nothing elÅ¿e, as appears by theÅ¿e enÅ¿uing undeniable reaÅ¿ons.</p>
                  <p>1. By the word of God, he hath predeÅ¿tinated us, according to the good pleaÅ¿ure of his will, <hi>EpheÅ¿. 1. 5. Rom.</hi> 11. 5.</p>
                  <p>So then we are not elected for foreÅ¿een faith, for every cauÅ¿e is before the effect, now faith is after election, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48.</p>
                  <p>So in the next place we are not elected for any foreÅ¿een works, for the ApoÅ¿tle doth exculde all works from being either cauÅ¿es of election or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
                     </hi> 9. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>3. The ends of election may be reduced to theÅ¿e three heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The glory of God, and the celebration, and declaration of his mercy, <hi>Romans 9. 23. EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Å¿econd end is, that we Å¿hould be ho. ly, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1. 4. He did not chuÅ¿e us becauÅ¿e we were then holy, but that we might be holy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third end is the Å¿alvation and glory of the elect, therefore they are Å¿aid to be ordained to eternal life, and prepared unto glory, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿en unto Å¿alvation, <hi>Acts 13. 48. Rom. 9. 23. 2 TheÅ¿.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The effects of election, are the mediation of ChriÅ¿t, adoption, vocation, Å¿aving faith, juÅ¿tifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, glorification, in a word, Gods election is the root of all gifts of God in us, and the foundation of all Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits beÅ¿towed upon us.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:170103:204"/>5. The Subject of election is double, the firÅ¿t is him in who we are elected, and that is ChriÅ¿t, he hath choÅ¿en us in him, Å¿aith <hi>Paul, EpheÅ¿.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>The other Subject is the perÅ¿ons that are elected, and theÅ¿e are not all the Å¿ons of <hi>Adam</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for he that taketh all, and refuÅ¿eth none, cannot properly be Å¿aid to chuÅ¿e; the elect conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed comparatively, are a little flock, a remnant, a garden incloÅ¿ed, a Å¿pring Å¿hut up, a fountain Å¿ealed, they be as one of a City, two of a tribe, they be but a handful to a houÅ¿e full, a drop to the Ocean. Yet if we conÅ¿ider them Å¿imply in themÅ¿elves, they are an innumerable number, that cannot be numbred, <hi>EpheÅ¿. 5. 23. Many Å¿hall come from the EaÅ¿t and WeÅ¿t, and Å¿hall Å¿it down in the Kingdom of God,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. <hi>By the obedience of ChriÅ¿t, many Å¿hall be made righteous, Rev. 7. 9. John</hi> Å¿aith he Å¿aw an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude of all Nations and tongues which Å¿tood before the lamb, cloathed with long white robes, and palms in their hands, Å¿o that the number of Gods elect, conÅ¿idered by themÅ¿elves alone, is great.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Prerogatives of the Elect, which no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate can partake of, are as followeth.</p>

Now the miÅ¿ery of the Å¿oul after death, is either particular or general: particular is that which liteth upon the Å¿oul immediately, as Å¿oon as Å¿he is Å¿eparated from the body, Å¿he is Å¿aid to Å¿tand before the throne of God, and Å¿o forthwith Å¿he is carried by the evil Angels with violence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, where Å¿he is kept as in a priÅ¿on, in everlaÅ¿ting pains and chains, under darkneÅ¿s unto the Judgement of the great day: but not in that extremity of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Å¿he Å¿hal receive at the laÅ¿t day; there thy laÅ¿civious eyes Å¿hall be afflicted with Å¿ights of ghoÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿pirits: Thy curious ears Å¿hall be affrighted with hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous noyÅ¿e of howling Devils, and the gnaÅ¿hing teeth of damned Reprobates: thy dainty noÅ¿e Å¿hall be cloyed with noyÅ¿om Å¿tench, thy delicate taÅ¿te Å¿hall be pined with intolerable hunger, and thy drunken throat Å¿hall be parched with nnquenchable thirÅ¿t, thy mind Å¿hall be tormented to think how fooliÅ¿hly thou haÅ¿t loÅ¿t heaven, and gotten helliÅ¿h pains for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary riches; thou haÅ¿t loÅ¿t the eternal treaÅ¿ure, and changed heavens felicity for hells fury; where thou Å¿halt have puniÅ¿hment without pitty, miÅ¿ery without mercy, Å¿orrow without Å¿uccour, crying without comfort, miÅ¿chief without meaÅ¿ure, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without eaÅ¿e, where the worm dyeth not,

In a word, the Å¿econd coming of ChriÅ¿t might be farther proved by the immutability of Gods decree, and infallibility of his promiÅ¿es, and impartiality of his juÅ¿tice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I meet with no Å¿ort of people denying this truth, except a few of thoÅ¿e Å¿poken of in the GoÅ¿pel, Å¿aying, where is the promiÅ¿e of his coming? theÅ¿e people have renounced their reaÅ¿on, and made nonÅ¿enÅ¿e the mother of their devotion, &amp; therefore their arguments are not worth the anÅ¿wering: but the great difficulty lieth amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e men that do believe a Å¿econd coming of ChriÅ¿t in power and great glory, and theÅ¿emen fall into theÅ¿e three ranks; the firÅ¿t Å¿aith that ChriÅ¿t Å¿hall come and reign perÅ¿onally on the earth a thouÅ¿and years before the laÅ¿t judgement; a Å¿econd Å¿ort Å¿tands up, and Å¿aith, he Å¿hall not reign perÅ¿onally, but Å¿piritually a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and years in his Saints; a third Å¿ort Å¿teps in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the two former, Å¿aying there is neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onal

reign, nor Å¿piritual reign to be looked for at ChriÅ¿ts next coming, for he comes to judge the world, and Å¿o to put an end to all things here below, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let the reader conÅ¿ider, that it is with us now, a little before the Å¿econd coming of ChriÅ¿t, as it was with the Jews and others, a little before the firÅ¿t coming of ChriÅ¿t; for it is apparent they were in three diviÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as we now are, as appears by their darkneÅ¿s in theÅ¿e three portions of Scripture that Å¿peaks of ChriÅ¿ts firÅ¿t coming.</p>
               <p>One Scripture Å¿aid <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. thou <hi>Bethleem,</hi> out of thee Å¿hall come one to rule <hi>IÅ¿rael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Scripture Å¿aid <hi>IÅ¿aiah</hi> 9. 2, 6. the land of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthaly,</hi> the people which were in darkneÅ¿s have Å¿een a great light, <hi>ver. 6. for unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A third Scripture, <hi>HoÅ¿.</hi> 11. 1. we read theÅ¿e words, out of Egypt have I called my Son, now in theÅ¿e three Scriptures the Prophets did Å¿eem to vary in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and the people after, about the coming of ChriÅ¿t in fleÅ¿h, differing as to the place where, or in which of theÅ¿e three ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be born; this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of theirs begat this great queÅ¿tion in Court, <hi>Mat. 2. 4. Herod</hi> gathered together all the chief PrieÅ¿ts and Scribes, and demanded of them where ChriÅ¿t Å¿hould be born, and they Å¿aid unto him, in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> &amp;c. Now the thing that I would have the reader to take Å¿pecial notice of, is this, that theÅ¿e three Scriptures were fulfilled at the coming of ChriÅ¿t, one after another, for he was born in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> called out of Egypt, and came to the land of <hi>Zebulon,</hi> and there preached, and the people that Å¿ate in darkneÅ¿s Å¿aw a great light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why may

                  <p n="2">2. Some conceive that by the day is meant a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and years, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome are Å¿aid to Å¿it on thrones, and have judgement given unto them, that is power of Judging, and to live and reign with ChriÅ¿t a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿and years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. but I conceive that this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reign of a thouÅ¿and years cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood of the laÅ¿t Judgement, becauÅ¿e death the laÅ¿t enemy Å¿hall in the reÅ¿urrection be deÅ¿troyed; now after the end of the thouÅ¿and years mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Saint <hi>John,</hi> Satan Å¿hall be looÅ¿ed out of the priÅ¿on, and the nations deceived by him, Å¿hall compaÅ¿s the camp of the Saints about, and the beloved City; and fire Å¿hall come down from God out of heaven and devour them all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others Å¿eem more Å¿afely to apprehend that the day here mentioned is to be taken improperly, for time indefinitely, it being in Scripture very ordinary to put a day for time: in an acceptable time have I heard thee, in a day of Salvation have I helped thee, <hi>IÅ¿a. 49. 8.

               <p>The end of the world is the deÅ¿truction of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible univerÅ¿e: as the wicked are thruÅ¿t into hell, and the godly entred into heaven: this is called the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ummation of the world, it Å¿hall be deÅ¿troyed by fire, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 6, 7, 10, 12, &amp;c.</hi> but what kind of fire this is, he only knows, who is himÅ¿elf a conÅ¿uming fire.</p>
