            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170103:8"/>
ſure ruleof the written word, for a ſuppoſed or pretended light within, who not contenting themſelves with thoſe plain and precious rules, and that clear light that ſhines in the word, they are only led by their own phantaſies, daily crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to themſelves diverſity of new opinions, and ſo break the bonds of love, and fall off from the communion of Saints, as though it were no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their Creed, and ſo fall to judging, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and condemning men for not doing as they do; contending for Cummin and Annis, putting off a hat, and wearing ribans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not only ſo, but alſo hate, malign, and moſt bitterly and uncharitably cenſure all thoſe that differ from them. Reader, I ſhall here in this Book preſent thee with all that I have learned, or at leaſt with the ſum and ſubſtance of all that I have gained this four and twenty years, by reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hearing of Sermons, conferring with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and peruſing their writings, together with ſeveral things that God hath immediately darted in upon my heart; but I have not received as I know of, nor here preſented any of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or immediate teachings, ſave that, and only that which is agreeable to the word of God, as far as I underſtand his mind therein: neither have I made it my work to contend for, or cry up any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſt, but rather it doth much grieve my heart to ſee what a ſtate moſt menare in here,
<pb facs="tcp:170103:8"/>
each tugging for his intereſt, and ſo whilſt they are contending for the garment, the power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is much abated.</p>
            <p>I would intreat thee Reader to weigh things in the ballance of Righteouſneſs, love and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and then I am confident that there will be none that hath the work of grace upon their ſouls, unleſs they be under ſome violent fit of temptation, but in the main will ſweetly own, and ſpiritually bleſs God for the revelation of the precious things contained in this little Book; here being ſomething of every thing needful to be known and practiced, for the obtaining of which I have imitated the Bee, that goes forth of the hive, and gathers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from ſeveral ſorts of flowers, and hearbs, and ſometimes from weeds. And for the compiling of theſe things together, as they have a connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and dependance one upon another, I have borrowed a little time from my particular calling, and from my ſleep, and recreation. If I have done this work well, it is that which I deſired, but if ſlenderly and meanly, it is becauſe I could do it no better. I muſt confeſs I rather liſp then ſpeak plain in the things of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cover all my imperfections with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of love. for it hath been compiled in the midſt of many perſonal tryals; if thou find any imperfections, yet let not the truth of God ſuffer through my weakneſs; to the Law and to

               <p>THE Father ſent forth the Son, and the Son ſent forth the Holy-Ghoſt, yet Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt was never ſeparated one from the other. As there is one God Father of all, and one Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt redeemer of the world, ſo there is one ſanctifying Spirit of grace: and as it is the office of the Father to elect, and the office of the Son to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, ſo it is the office of the Holy-ghoſt to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe, and only thoſe, whom the Father hath elected, and the Son redeemed: and as the Father doth love freely, and the Son manifeſt that love, ſo the ſpirit doth evidence that love to, and in the ſouls of the Saints: the Father loves a Chriſtian as redeemed by Chriſt, Chriſt looks upon him, and loves him as given by the Father for him to redeem: the Holy-Ghoſt ſeeing the love of the Father, in chooſing him, and the love of the Son in redeeming him, he alſo ſets his love upon him, and manifeſts it unto him.</p>
               <p>So that as election to life is by God the Father, and redemption by God the Son, ſo juſtification, ſanctification, and reſtauration into the Image of God is by the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>So that in the unity of the God-head there be three of one ſubſtance, power and eternity; God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy-Ghoſt; the Father is of none other, begotten nor proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy-Ghoſt eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son: See <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 16, 17, &amp; 28. 19.

For through it (waſt thou that didſt ſin) yet thou art not fallen alone; but we all that came of thee, as being then in thee, we are infected by thee, and ſo are become Satans conqueſt, out of whoſe hands there is no redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs the Lord Jeſus Chriſt come down from heaven, and lead captivity captive, and open the priſon doors, and let the priſoners go free, all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> poſterity are pertakers of his ſin and miſery.</p>

Or effectuall calling is the work of Gods ſpirit in us, whereby he doth, firſt, convince us of our ſins and miſery, enlightning our minds in the knowledge of Chriſt, and renewing our wills, he doth perſwade and invite us to embrace Jeſus Chriſt freely tendred to us. We read that many were called to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but they made their excuſes, and moſt of thoſe that came were compelled to come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 23. the Lord doth force none by violence, but draw them by perſwaſions.</p>

So Chriſt is given for a Covenant to the people: that is the Covenant of Grace takes its being from Chriſt to us: <hi>Adam</hi> was all mankind, as all mankind was in <hi>Adam,</hi> in the loyns of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo Chriſt is the Covenant, and all the Covenant is as it were in the loins of Chriſt, and ſprings to us out of him; in this ſenſe he is the Covenant-maker, he is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-undertaker, he is the Covenant-manager, he

                  <head>The ſecond thing to be enquired into, is with whom this Covenant was firſt made.</head>
                  <p>THis Covenant was not made with us, but with Chriſt for us; God did not immediately make this Covenant with us, we were children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and of wrath, who were not capable of any ſuch Covenant and conditions, but it was made with Chriſt for us, that upon the making of his ſoul an offering for ſin, he would give unto his ſeed eternall life, <hi>Zech. 9. 11. As for thee alſo by the blood of thy Covenant, I have ſent forth thy priſoners out of the pit wherein is no water: Adam</hi> loſt his righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the foundation of the firſt Covenant: But the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> can never be loſt, it being grounded upon better promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant made with Chriſt, hath theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>Gen. 12. 3. In thee ſhall all families of the earth be bleſſed, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20. All the promiſes of God, are Yea and Amen in him; ſo then this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170103:26"/>
was made with him actively, as a perſon that performed all the conditions upon which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were grounded; but with us paſſively, as the Perſons to whom the benefits of theſe promiſes do belong: if Chriſt merited nothing for himſelf, but wholly for the Elect of God, then all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to him do belong to them; or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which was made with him as Mediator, doth belong to us, for whom he doth mediate. Now the parties concerned in this Covenant, are firſt God the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, and the Church or body of Chriſt, for whom he was to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate. Now this Covenant being made with Chriſt, he as a Surety is bound to perform and ſee perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the duties that God requires of believers; ſo he was arreſted, and brought to the bar of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, where he is convicted, adjudged, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned as a ſinfull tranſgreſſor, ſo he ſuffered the uttermoſt rigor of the Law, and not one grain of juſtice abated him, nor a farthing of the debt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him, no nor ſo much as one ſin unaccounted for or blotted out, till ſatisfaction was firſt made and given. But after the full account and perfect payment, this Surety Chriſt Jeſus pleaded for a diſmiſſion, and diſcharge, and ſo got a generall diſcharge, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and releaſment, under the King of Heavens hand and ſeal for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any man deſire further ſatisfaction, whether this Covenant was firſt made with Chriſt for us, yea or no. Let him conſult with theſe precious Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Pſalm 89. 24, 27, 28. Hebr. 13. 20. Iſaiah 42. 6. Iſa. 55. 3. Zach. 6. 13. Iſa. 50. 56. Zach. 9. 11. Iſa.</hi> 53. 10.</p>

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:170103:26"/>Now if any one ask, what were the conditions between the Father and the Son, when this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made, they are as followeth. Firſt ſee what God the Father promiſed unto Chriſt on his part.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he would anoint him, and fill him with the Spirit above all others, <hi>Heb. 1. 9. Iſa.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he would prepare him a body to ſacrifice for ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he would uphold him, and ſtrengthen him, that he ſhould not be aſhamed by the things he ſhould ſuffer, <hi>Iſa. 42. 6. &amp;</hi> 50. 5, 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he would juſtifie and glorifie all his ſeed, <hi>Iſa. 50. 8. Joh. 17. 22, 24, Iſa.</hi> 53. 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That he ſhould ſee and enjoy the travell of his ſoul, and the purchaſes of his blood, <hi>Iſa. 53. 10. Heb.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That he ſhould have all power in heaven and in earth given him, <hi>till all his enemies were made his footſtool, Epheſ. 5. 25, 27, Matthew 28. 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 28.</p>
                  <p>Next let us examine what Chriſt did perform or promiſe to perform on his part,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To become a Mediator, Surety and Saviour for all thoſe that his Father ſhould give him, <hi>Heb. 8. 6. Heb. 7. 22. Act. 13. 23. Ioh. 17. 11, 12. Epheſ. 1. 10. Col. 1. 20. 1 John</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To take upon him the nature of man, and ſo to become fleſh, in his Fathers appointed time, <hi>Gal. 4. 4. Mat. 11. 27. John</hi> 17. 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he would glorifie his Father, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, revealing and doing his will, <hi>John 15. 10. John</hi> 6. 39.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170103:27"/>4. That he would ſuffer and ſatisfie perſonally and perfectly for the ſins of men, <hi>Luke 24. 46. Hoſ. 13. 14. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That he would bring himſelf, and all thoſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by his Father unto glory, <hi>Heb. 10. 14. Joh. 14. 4, 9. Iohn</hi> 10. 18.</p>
                  <p>The word of God doth contain the Articles of this Covenant; thoſe that deſire further ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſearch the Scriptures, wherein you ſhall find that Chriſt did willingly undertake this work, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7, 9. and did faithfully diſcharge it, <hi>Heb. 10. 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</hi> ſo our reconciliation was wrought by the Son, <hi>Iſa. 61. 1. Iohn 1. 3. Iohn 5. 36, 37. Col. 1. 16, 17. Hebr. 1. 3. Iohn 5. 17. &amp;</hi> 3. 17. and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 13. &amp;</hi> 4. 30.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="subsection">
                  <head>The third thing to be enquired into, is when this Covenant was made with us.</head>
                  <p>THere be three ſet times wherein God may be ſaid to make this Covenant: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Immediately after the fall of <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head; theſe few words comprehended the ſum of all Law and Goſpel, and the Covenant therein contained: <hi>Tit. 1. 2. in hope of eternall life, which God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie promiſed before the world began, 2 Tim. 1. 9. who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Ieſus before the world began.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Covenant in a ſenſe may be ſaid to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170103:27"/>
made with us at the death of Chriſt, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the benefits were merited and procured for us: ſo this Covenant came to be confirmed by the death of the Teſtator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17, 18. Hence his blood is called the blood of the everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 20. And the blood of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Covenant may be ſaid to be made with us, when God doth confirm upon us the benefits which are therein promiſed, which are many; I will inſtance but in three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is the matter and bleſſing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on Gods part, in theſe words, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, Ier.</hi> 31. 33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this Covenant Chriſt doth firſt give us grace imputed, and then grace: inherit all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Covenant, are the fruits and effects of Chriſts death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is alſo the promiſe that God will work out the manifeſtation, by which man ſhall ſee his intereſt in this Covenant, and his right and title to all the bleſſings thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now if we would yet farther know when this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made with Chriſt for us, let us weigh that text, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4. We are choſen in him, before the foundation of the world.</hi> Now if Election be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world (ſure it is) then alſo by the ſame ground the Covenant or promiſe was made before the foundation of the world, for the word doth prove the one as well as the other; theſe promiſes were made firſt to Chriſt on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, before they are made to us, becauſe the whole work of our redemption and ſalvation, was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170103:28"/>
between the Father and the Son, before the foundation of the world, and is afterwards reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in due time, as is evident, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. 2 Tim.</hi> 19.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="subsection">
                  <head>The fourth thing to be enquired into is, whether there be any conditions of this Covenant on our part, and if ſo, what thoſe conditions are.</head>
                  <p>WHat this Covenant is, with whom it was made, and when it was made, hath been laid down before: now it follows in order to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether there be any conditions on our part; and for anſwer unto which, let me give my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Covenant the Lord doth bequeath grace and glory on no other condition, but the death of the Teſtator, that is, Chriſt Jeſus: as the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was built upon the righteouſneſs of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> So the ſecond is built upon the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> and it will plainly appear in this Covenant of grace, that there is no condition on our part to entitle us to the bleſſing of it; it is true, to our head Chriſt this Covenant was conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, though to us it is free; to him it was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, hence Chriſt is called the Mediator, Witneſs and Surety of this new Covenant, and that this Covenant is without conditions on our part, will appear more fully by theſe enſuing reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe a Covenant of free grace cannot ſtand with conditions, for if it had conditions it would not be of grace, for grace is not grace, if it be not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170103:28"/>
every way free, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. and if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe to give a thing freely and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otinally are contradictions; and to ſay there is conditions as to us, is to ecclipſe the grace of God, and to open a door for vain man to boaſt. So that the whole glory of our juſtific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion and ſalvation ought to be given to the grace of God, and to the merits of Chriſt. If either of them did depend, and were obtained by works and conditions performed by us, it would not be of grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe that juſtification by grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conditions on our part, is the life and ſoul of the Goſpel, <hi>Galatians 1. 6, 7. I marvell that you are moved from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel, which is not another, but there be ſome that would pervert the Goſpel:</hi> how can there be another Goſpel, and yet not another Goſpel? Firſt it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, becauſe it is not poſſible there ſhould be two Goſpels; yet another Goſpel, becauſe men did turn it aſide in point of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe if any qualification or grace in us be a condition, Faith muſt needs be the condition, or one of the conditions; but if faith ſhould be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of grace, then it differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing from the Covenant of works, for it is as hard a thing for a man to believe, as it is to keep the whole Law.</p>
                  <p>Again, Faith cannot be the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170103:29"/>
becauſe we obtain it by the ſame means we obtain all other good things elſe, to wit by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 34.</p>
                  <p>Again, Faith and repentance, juſtification and ſanctification, are things purchaſed by Chriſt for us, and freely given to us, and are the effects and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Covenant, as doth appear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 38, 39, 40. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>It is true, Faith and repentance are means of our enjoying the comforts of the Covenant, but not the conditions flowing out of the nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; for every means is not a condition, though every condition be a means; ſo that we are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, as the condition of the Covenant, but organically and inſtrumentall.</p>
                  <p>So that all the bleſſings of the new Covenant are called gifts, not conditions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. and theſe are gifts that are given freely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. we chuſe him, becauſe he firſt chuſeth us; and we love him, becauſe he firſt loveth us: we cannot ſay God is our God, till he doth firſt ſay, we are his people; we cannot ſay we will run after him, till he doth firſt draw us; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we bring forth fruit, unleſs we abide in the Vine; nor purifie our ſelves as he is pure, unleſs we have this hope in us; ſo that we may not expect the effects before the cauſe, nor the light before the ſun, or heat before the fire.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There be no conditions in this Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it works and effects in us all things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us.</p>
                  <p>Now faith, repentance and obedience doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170103:29"/>
the Perſons that are ſaved, but not the terms or conditions upon which they do obtain ſalvation; that interpretation of any Scripture, that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve a contradiction, is not to be admitted; but to ſay faith is the condition of the Covenant, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs contradiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But are there not conditions required on our part? pray read theſe two Scriptures <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 14. <hi>The ſecrets of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. <hi>Incline your ear and come unto me, hear and your ſoul ſhall live. And I will make an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with you, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, in theſe Scriptures there are three things required of us.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. To fear him.</item>
                     <item>2. To incline our ear and come.</item>
                     <item>3. To hear, and our ſoul ſhall live.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But are not all theſe three things promiſed to us in the Covenant? and doth not God by his Spirit, work theſe things, with many more, in us? is there any one thing required of us, that he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to work in us? ſurely no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But if faith be not an active, it is a paſſive condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have heard ſome ſay ſo, but could never ſee a man able to prove it to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Some ſay that this Covenant is conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, no otherwiſe, then in reſpect of Gods order and method, in beſtowing the bleſſings of it upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> In this ſenſe it may be granted (it is ſo) ſtill keeping cloſe to this, that not in a proper, but in an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170103:30"/>
improper ſenſe, the Covenant may be ſaid to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall; for as hath been ſaid before, the Covenant of grace and life by Chriſt is every way free, and unconditionally on mans part, elſe how doth it differ from a Covenant of works? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. And if by grace, then it is by gift, for grace and gift you muſt underſtand are all one: grace is nothing but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, freely given, and of his own accord communicated; and if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you bring grace unto works, or works unto grace, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other, or both, are made void; as much as to ſay, theſe two things are inconſiſtent, they cannot ſtand together; that we ſhould partake of Chriſt through grace, and works both, they will not ſtand together; grace muſt ſtand alone, or works alone, for one doth directly ſtand in oppoſition to the other; and the Scripture is plain and clear, that the Father expects nothing of men, no qualification, or ſpirituall diſpoſition, before or upon the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of his Son; the condition on our part is to receive it, and to improve it, and walk worthy of it, and when we come ſhort herein, we are ſaid to break Covenant on our part, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 17. <hi>&amp; Iſa:</hi> 24. 5. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 25, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>The fifth thing to be enquired into is, whether it be one and the ſame Covenant of grace that was in force before the Law, and under the Law, and under the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>THere is but one Covenant of grace, and a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold adminiſtration of that Covenant; the one before the Law, the other under the Law, the third under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before the Law the promiſe of grace was, that notwithſtanding man had thus rebelled againſt God, yet the ſeed of the woman, which was the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſhould bruiſe the head of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Covenant was given or publiſhed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> till Chriſts reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being placed in ceremonies, types, figures and ſhadows, all pointing at the ſubſtance that was for to come, all the Laws and Ordinances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in full force and vertue; for he that did but neglect circumciſion, was to be cut off from the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ſame Covenant in the dayes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles is renewed, and the ſubſtance of the Covenant more fully opened and cleared, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more perſons are renewed, and more graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, being alwaies to endure one and the ſame; hence it is called a new Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31.</p>
                  <p>Now it is the ſame Covenant of grace both in the old and new teſtaments, only the difference ſtands thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:170103:31"/>1. It is larger in the New Teſtament, even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the Gentiles, and not confined to the Jews as then it was, 1 <hi>Theſſal. 4. 5. Epheſ. 2. 11. &amp;</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is plainer now, then it was in types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, blood of beaſts, incenſe, waſhing with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and other rudiments; ſo that now things are ſeen more plainly in their ſubſtance, then in paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or proſpective glaſſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is ſtronger, this makes perfect, the other could not, being weak and unprofitable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that adminiſtration it is now diſanulled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is more firm, being confirmed with an oath, and by the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It gives more knowledge, that in compariſon of the Law, they ſhall not need to teach one another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It hath a better Mediator, even Chriſt, who by his interceſſion reconciled the diſagreeing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and undertaken for both ſides; on Gods part, that theſe and theſe things ſhall be done, which he hath promiſed; on our part, to give ſatisfaction by his own death, and make us obedient to his Father.

                  <p>Although the Covenant of grace be the ſame then and now, yet there is a difference in regard of the manner of diſpenſation and revealing it: being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall waies propounded, according to the ſeverall

times, ages, ſtates and conditions of the Church: delivered one way, before the coming of Chriſt, and another way afterward. And therefore in regard of the old way and manner of adminiſtring of it, it is called the old Covenant; and in regard of the new manner of diſpenſing it, its called the new Covenant; the ſame Covenant is therefore called both new and old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 13.</p>

                  <p>1. The Covenant in the former diſpenſation was more burthenſome, as will appear by theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The burthen of their coſtly ſacrifices, ſutable to the quality of the perſon, and nature of the ſin.</p>

                  <head>The ſixth thing to be enquired into is, whether this Covenant may not be broken, as the firſt Covenant of works was.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AS this Covenant was not made with us, but with Chriſt for us, ſo it cannot be broken by us; and as it was not made for our good works, ſo it cannot be diſanulled by our ſins, becauſe the Lord hath founded it upon his own immutable word and promiſe, which he hath confirmed by an oath; hence it is called an everlaſting Covenant, becauſe his everlaſting love cauſed him to make it, and becauſe it ceaſeth not when we are in glory, for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in glory is promiſed in this Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Covenant cannot be broken, becauſe the righteouſneſs upon which it is founded is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs, and everlaſting pardon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. And everlaſting kindneſs, and everlaſting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and everlaſting joy, and everlaſting conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 16, 17. Iſa. 35. 10. Pſal. 100. 5. Dan. 9. 24. Jer.</hi> 31. 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Covenant cannot be broken, becauſe he that made it is an everlaſting God, the motives that did move him to make it was everlaſting love, and the Righteouſneſs upon which it is grounded, is, as is ſaid before, everlaſting, yea all the legacies and bleſſings
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170103:32"/>
thereof are everlaſting: to have and to hold ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt our head is more ſecure and laſting then in our own keeping; God will no more truſt us with our ſelves, nor with our righteouſneſs, by which we ſhall ſtand before him.</p>
                  <p>For if when we were truly good, and had no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption nor ſin in us, we did then fall, much more ſhould we do ſo now, were not Chriſt our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker; he will keep it for us, and us for it, ſo that now the promiſes of righteouſneſs, life and ſalvation, are ſure to all the ſeed of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3, 4, 5. 2 Cor. 12. 9. Rom.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Covenant cannot be broken, becauſe the Lord hath ſworn it ſhall not, <hi>Iſa. 54. 9, 10. For as I have ſworn that the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>ſhould no more go over the earth, ſo have I ſworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee, for the mountains ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and the hils be removed, but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the Covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on thee.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Do we not read in Scripture, that the Lord will break Covenant with the people that break Covenant with him, <hi>viz. Ezek. 16. 59. Zach. 11. 10. Iſa.</hi> 24. 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Conſider, that as this Covenant was not at firſt made with us, ſo it cannot at laſt be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by us, and as it was not made for our good works, ſo it cannot be diſanulled for our ſins; and for anſwer to the three places of Scripture, in this objection alleadged, let us conſider them with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed judgement; the firſt Scriptures is that in <hi>Ezek. 16. 59. For thus ſaith the Lord God, I will even
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170103:33"/>
deal with thee as thou haſt done, which haſt deſpiſed the oath, in breaking the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now compare theſe words, with 60. and 62. verſes, and you will find, that although man doth break the Covenant on his part, yet God will not break Covenant on his part, <hi>nevertheleſs ſaith the Lord, I will remember my Covenant with thee, and eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Scripture is that in <hi>Zach. 11. 10. And I took my ſtaff, even beauty, and cut it aſunder, that I might break my Covenant which I had made with all the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwer unto this, conſider, the people often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times broke it on their part, as doth appear, <hi>Lev. 26. 44. Deut. 31. 16, 20. Judg. 2. 20. Jer. 11. 10. &amp;</hi> 31. 32. But for all that, God never did nor would break it on his part totally, ſee <hi>Judg. 2. 1. Pſal. 89. 34. Jer. 33. 20, 21. Exek.</hi> 16. 60, 62. And this Covenant here doth relate more immediately to that peace which he hath granted to his Church, that ſhe ſhould be no more aſſaulted nor moleſted by any ſtrange Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo for that place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 5. the Covenant was broken but on the peoples part, as appears by the expreſs words of the text.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay more, the old Covenant was for to laſt but for a time, till the time of reformation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 4. but the new Covenant is to laſt for ever; this makes much againſt that dangerous opinion of thoſe that ſlight and neglect the ordinances of the Goſpel, under a pretence of ſetting up Chriſts Kingdom.</p>

                  <head>The ſeventh thing to be enquired into is, what means ſhould one make uſe of to get into this Covenant of Grace.</head>
                  <p>THE ſafeſt and ſpeedieſt way to get into this Covenant, is to reſt upon Chriſt alone, and to fetch the comfort of our juſtification from his perfect obedience, only we may not put our ſelves or others upon the evidencing of our juſtification by our election, nor our election by our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but both juſtification and election by a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt reliance upon Gods free grace and love held forth in abſolute promiſes.</p>
                  <p>1. The firſt means, Let a man get up, and keep up a holy fear of God upon his heart, and then thou comeſt under the promiſe, <hi>Pſal. 25. 14. The ſecrets of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Conſider what a pickle poor man was in, even as bad as thy ſelf, when God did firſt enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, or when God did manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be in Covenant with him, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. from verſe 2. to the 11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 30, 33, 34.</p>
                  <p>It is an apparent truth unto all experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that when God firſt enters into Covenant with men, he finds them in their blood, and in their infidelity.</p>
                  <p>3. Means to get into this Covenant, endeavour to believe, for although faith be not an inſtrument to procure it, yet it is to receive juſtification and ſalvation, which is freely given us by Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170103:34"/>
and ſo peace in the ſoul doth come by believing: God is the Author and giver of peace, Chriſt the Prince and promiſer of peace, the Spirit the worker and ſealer of peace, and the Goſpel the word and ground of peace, and the Miniſters the meſſengers of peace, and this bleſſed Covenant is ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Covenant of peace: but if thou endeavour to believe and canſt not, conſider, God doth not take men into Covenant becauſe they believe and are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that they might believe and be holy; in this Covenant he doth promiſe faith and holineſs to men, and through it he doth convey it to them, and this Covenant being without conditions, it doth give a man the greateſt encouragement to believe, and caſt himſelf into the arms of Chriſt, and to put on a ſtrong confidence of inheriting the precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſeeing that in their accompliſhment, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon works and conditions on our part, let us then do as <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 31, 32, 33.</p>
                  <p>Yea let us reſolve with the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not to be beaten off with any diſcouragements; this act of faith is ſtiled a taking the kingdom of heaven by force, <hi>Job 13. 15. though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> ſee 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>4. Dwell much upon the conſideration of thoſe promiſes that God hath made, <hi>viz.</hi> To bring men into the bonds of the Covenant, and to work a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, and an ability to receive what he gives: to believe what he ſaith, and to obſerve and do what he commandeth.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay more, would we indeed get into this Covenant? then the work we have to do is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>

                     <item>2. To get aſſurance that we have a title: the firſt is done by conſideration and believing: the ſecond is done by examination and diligence to make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you have ſaid before, that there is no condition of this Covenant on mans part: and now you put men upon the uſe of means to get into this Covenant: now I would fain know what difference there is between means and conditions, are they not as one?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every means is not a condition, though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition be a means.</p>
                  <p>Now Gods order and method in beſtowing the bleſſings of the Covenant upon a perſon, or a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is in the uſe of means, in <hi>Exek.</hi> 36. there are ſome ſixteen promiſes one after another, made to the people without any condition on the peoples part. <hi>Be it known ſaith the Lord to them, not for your ſakes, but for my own names ſake, I will do this for you,</hi> but I will hand theſe mercies to you in the uſe of means, verſe 37. <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſurely miſtaken is Mr. <hi>Samuel Richardſon,</hi> that ſaith in his book called the Saints deſire, <hi>pag.</hi> 46. that there is no means to be uſed by man to get an intereſt in this Covenant, or to partake of it.</p>

               <div n="8" type="subsection">
                  <head>The eighth thing to be enquired into is this, when may a man or woman be ſaid to be in this Covenant.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. A Man or woman, old or young, is then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, actually and expreſly in Covenant with God, when God hath come to it in a promiſe of the Goſpel, ſo that the ſoul doth feel it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the promiſe, then it begins to know he is in Covenant; ſo the Lord in and through this Covenant, brings a poor ſoul to ſee, and ſeeing, to admire the ſuperabundant riches of his free grace and love, and ſo humbly and thankfully embraceth the ſame: and the heart thus wrought upon, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly deſires that ſuch kindneſſes of God might not ſlip out of mind, but that the conſideration of this ſoul-raviſhing, heart-melting grace and loving kindneſs might carry him forth ſtedfaſtly to believe, and dearly to love, cheerfully to honour and obey this God of mercy in ſoul, body and ſpirit, ſo long as the Sun and Moon endureth: ſo the ſoul begins to be carried forth out of ſelf unto God, and in God alone finds reſt and ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:170103:35"/>2. Faith and works doth evidence our being in the Covenant; faith doth evidence it to our ſelves, and works to others, but faith and works do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence no otherwiſe then organically, as it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan or inſtrument by which we do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then may a man be ſaid to be in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when he doth find his ſoul carried forth to a ſecret reſting, relying, leaning, ſtaying and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Chriſt alone for life and happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A man may be ſaid to be in this Covenant, when he doth find within this frame of ſpirit. Oh that I had more of God, that I were filled with Chriſt: oh that I had his righteouſneſs to cover me, his grace to pardon me, his power to ſupport me, his wiſdom to counſell me, his loving kindneſs to refreſh me, and his happineſs to crown me.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, a man may be ſaid to be in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when in ſome good meaſure a ſoul doth come to ſee that Chriſt did legally interpoſe and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf between God and man, to mediate and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for them, and ſo voluntarily became obedient unto his Fathers will, and by undergoing, bearing and ſuffering the warth and curſe due to him for his ſins. And ſo Chriſt took away the ſins, reconciled him to God, redeemed him from the Law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him from the wrath to come.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A man may be ſaid to be in this Covenant, when he doth freely accept of free pardon, and a ſurety under the Goſpel: Goſpel grace neglected is the great condemnation of the world: how mindfull ſhould we be of the Apoſtles counſell? Receive not the grace of God in vain, that is, receive it not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170103:36"/>
only in word, but in power, as it is a quickning ſpirit, or ſpirit and life; not begetting a form only of a profeſſion, but as changing and transforming into the Image of God, and altering the inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the heart.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A man may be ſaid to be in this Covenant, when he finds in himſelf a conſcientious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the word of God, for ſelf purifying: the word hath a purifying faculty in it, <hi>John 15. 3. Ye are clean through the word that I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to you:</hi> now the word doth purifie theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As an antidote againſt ſins, <hi>Pſal. 119. 11. Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi>

                  <head>The ninth thing to be conſidered of, is this, wherein doth the Covenant of grace, and the Covenant of works differ.</head>
                  <p>FOR anſwer hereunto, conſider the vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law and the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law affords not a drop of grace, it beſtows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing freely: the language of the Law is, do thou and live; if not die; no work no wages; but in the Goſpel, the yoak of perſonall obedience is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from believers to their ſurety; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them to pay; all that they have to do, is to hunger and feed; their happineſs is free, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of themſelves, though coſtly to Chriſt, who by his merits hath purchaſed for them whatſoever they would obtain, and by his Spirit worketh in them whatſoever he requires.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Covenant of works is old, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is new: the firſt is the Law of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſecond is the Law of the Spirit; the firſt is a Law of death, the ſecond is a Law of life: the firſt was wounding, the ſecond is healing; the firſt a naturall law, the ſecond a ſpirituall law; the firſt a law of types, the ſecond a law of ſubſtance: the firſt was to be done away, the ſecond is to continue; the firſt a Covenant of earthly bleſſings, the ſecond a Covenant of ſpirituall bleſſings: the firſt was to ſtand for a time, the ſecond was to ſtand for ever.</p>
                  <p>Again, this Covenant of grace doth differ from the Covenant of works in the univerſality and large extent of it: the firſt Covenant requires a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170103:37"/>
in us, the ſecond doth give and accept of a righteouſneſs which is anothers, and imputed to us.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that Religion for the ſubſtance thereof, was ever one and the ſame, and unchangeable, as appears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1, 2. And ſo the word of God written by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets, did contain whatſoeever was needfull for the ſalvation of the Iſraelites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 26. But the in New Teſtament our Saviour made known unto his Diſciples, the laſt and full will or Covenant of his heavenly father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. 18. and what they received of him, they faithfully preached unto the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. And the ſum of what they preached is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to writing, and left upon record for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 1, 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>The difference between the Covenant of works, and the Covenant of grace, may be reduced to theſe three heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt was a miniſtration of the letter, a naked Commandment, carrying with it no aptneſs, diſpoſition, or ability to keep it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It breeds enmity and fear; looking on God as a hard taskmaſter, and ſo fils the ſoul full of terrours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a miniſtration of death, namely by the curſe, to them that keep it not.</p>
                  <p>But the Covenant of grace is a miniſtration of the Spirit, requiring no more then what it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170103:37"/>
to give. In a word, it is a miniſtration of the Spirit, of love, freedom, and righteouſneſs, and of life; for that it ſhews the guilty a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to ſatisfie the Law, and the way to obtain a Pardon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The firſt Covenant was made altogether upon condition on both ſides; the condition on Gods part was, they ſhould live; the condition on mans part was, he muſt do this: but in this Covenant there is not any condition, I mean in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>True it is, could we juſtifie the Law by keeping it; the Law would juſtifie us, in and by that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it. But now the Law is become weak and unable to juſtifie any man, though powerfull and ſtrong enough to condemn every man.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the Covenant of works a man is left to ſtand by his own ſtrength; but in the Covenant of Grace, God undertakes to keep us through faith to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the Covenant of works, Gods higheſt end is the glorifying of his Juſtice; and in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, it is to glorifie his grace. The voice of the Covenant of works, is like the firſt ſpeech of <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art the man;</hi> the voice of the Covenant of grace is like his after-ſpeech, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin:</hi> the voice of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, is, the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>In the Covenant of grace, he ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is help for ſuch as break the Covenant
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170103:38"/>
of works, but no help for ſuch as make void the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="subsection">
                  <head>The tenth thing to be enquired into is this, what is Gods oraer and method, that he generally makes us of, to bring his people into the bond of the Covenant, and to beſtow the bleſsings of the Covenant upon them.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt, in the making up of the Covenant between God and us: God is the firſt with us, he is the firſt mover, he begins with us, before we begin with him: we ſhould never ſeek to be in Covenant with him, if he did not firſt allure us, and draw us, invite us, and intreat us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 37. <hi>I will bring them (ſaith the Lord) into the bond of the Covenant:</hi> it is the Lord that brings them, they do not firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves.</p>
                  <p>1. God prepares his own way for entring into Covenant with us, and then he finiſheth the work, and in this preparation he doth theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He breaks us of our Covenant with hell and death, and makes us ſenſible of our undone eſtates, &amp; makes us to ſee that we are without God, without Chriſt, without hope, that we are not under mercy, that we are not as yet of his people, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He opens to us his mind and will, ſhewing himſelf willing to receive us to grace, and to enter into a new Covenant with us, yet again to take us to be his people, and he to be our God: and ſo he goes into the ſtreets, and open places, as it is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20, 21. and there makes publike procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: ho, every one that will, come ye to me,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170103:38"/>
and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 1. and if we come not at this firſt invitation, then he comes and beſeecheth us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. and ſpeaks to us as pittying us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12. and lamenting over us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. and all this he doth to perſwade us to come and ſtrike a Covenant with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the hearing of theſe promiſes and offers of grace, the Lord uſually ſcattereth ſome little ſeeds of faith in the hearts of thoſe that he will bring unto himſelf; which ſeeds being ſown, do quickly put forth, and act towards the Covenant, before by the Father tendred, and layes hold of it, as we ſee in <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Jaylor, <hi>Zacheus, &amp;c.</hi> So by an act of faith, we come to cloſe with the Covenant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and offered freely unto us, by accepting the grace offered, reſting upon God for all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which he hath promiſed; and then taking God to be a God over us, ſubmitting to his government and authority, to command us, and to rule us in all things according to his own will; theſe two things faith doth, and ſo takes hold of the Covenant more firmly, in the ſame way and order as God offers it. Firſt God makes himſelf known to us as a God of mercy, gracious, long ſuffering, pardoning iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tranſgreſſion and ſin, and ſo offers himſelf to be reconciled to us, though we have rebelled againſt him, promiſing to be a Father unto us, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of us in his beloved, as his ſons and daughters: and thus is the Covenant made up between God and us; and the ſoul now begins to ſay in it ſelf, I that was an enemy, he hath now reconciled unto himſelf; I that was in times paſt, without God, without Chriſt,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170103:39"/>
without promiſe, without Covenant, without hope, and none of Gods people—Yet now I have God for my God, Chriſt is my peace, and I am now become one of Gods people, the Covenant of his peace now belongeth to me, and the Lord is become my ſalvation, ſaying as <hi>Jacob, Gen. 33. 11. The Lord hath had mercy on me, therefore I have enough, I have all that my heart hath deſired.</hi> The Lord doth acquaint the ſoul with thoſe abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which ſhew unto us the only cauſe of our ſalvation, even free grace and no other thing. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are a foundation for the faith of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or dependance to ſtay upon, they yield a ſingular encouragement to a poor dejected ſoul, that finds nothing in it ſelf but ſin and miſery, with hope to caſt it ſelf upon the free grace of God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he looks at nothing in us, for which he ſhould ſave us: there be two acts of faith, one of adherence or dependancy, another of aſſurance; there be alſo two kinds of promiſes, abſolute, and conditionall: mark now how theſe do fit and anſwer one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the abſolute promiſes to the faith of adherence: the conditionall to the faith of aſſurance. Now faith helps us to cloſe with the Covenant, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to walk with God according to the Covenant which we have made; there is a keeping of Covenant required of us, as well as a making a Covenant with God, <hi>Gen. 17. 7, 9. Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. The Saints are ſaid to make a Covenant with God, but in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 18. they are ſaid to keep his Covenant; ſo there is a making and a keeping of Covenant, and both by Faith.</p>

                  <head>The eleventh thing to be enquired into is, what are the bleſsings and benefits of this Covenant to us-ward.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> WE can never know the things which are given to us of God, but by knowing of the Covenant, which conveys all the bleſſings from God to us. O let us lift up our hearts, to look for great things, great bleſſings, ſuch as the great God hath promiſed; the bleſſings are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our wants, the things of the Covenant are great things, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant is as full of bleſſings as of letters, or ſyllables, and more; it is a rich ſtorehouſe, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all manner of gifts and graces, ſpirituall and temporall; it is as a tree of life to thoſe that feed upon it, they ſhall live for ever; it is a Well of ſalvation, it is a fountain of good things, to ſatisfie every thirſty ſoul, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1. it is a treaſure full of goods, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 12. here is unſearchable riches, unſpeakable mercy, which can never be fathomed, or emptied: all theſe bleſſings of the Covenant are wrapped up in the promiſes of it, every promiſe of grace containing a bleſſing; as every threatning of the Law contains a curſe. Now the promiſes and bleſſings of the Covenant are of two ſorts: Firſt, of things ſpirituall and eternall. Secondly, of things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; the ſpirituall bleſſings of the Covenant are cheifly comprehended in theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Jer. 31. 31, 33. Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27, 28. Jer. 32. 38, 39, 40. Gen.</hi> 17. 7. God in Trinity enters into Covenant with us.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:170103:40"/>1. The Father enters into Covenant with us, and promiſeth to be a Father to us; hence ſaith the Lord, <hi>Exod. 4. 22. Iſrael is my ſon, my firſt born,</hi> and Jer. 31. 9, 20. <hi>is Ephraim my dear ſon, is he my pleaſant child?</hi> ſo the Lord hath a care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide both heavenly and earthly inheritance for his children: he hath alſo a care to nurture and inſtruct them in his wayes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt the ſon enters into Covenant with us, and ſpeaks to us, as in <hi>Iſa. 43. 1. Thou art mine:</hi> and Hoſea 13. 14. <hi>I will redeem them, I will ranſome them. Oh death, I will be thy death; thou haſt deſtroyed my people, but I will deſtroy thee;</hi> ſo he undertakes to take up all controverſies, which may fall between God and us, he promiſeth to reſtore us to the adoption of ſons, and to the inheritance of ſons, that we might be where he is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The holy ghoſt makes a Covenant with us, as <hi>Heb. 10. 15, 16. whereof the Holy-Ghoſt alſo is a witneſs to us,</hi> teſtifying of this Covenant, which he makes with us; although the Father be imployed in it, yet here is the power and work of the Holy-Ghoſt; what the Father hath purpoſed from all eternity, and the Son hath purchaſed for them in time, that the Holy-Ghoſt effects in them, and applies to them, <hi>viz.</hi> he enables them to apply the blood of Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſins, he writes the Law in our heats, he teacheth us, he waſheth us from our filthineſs, and comforteth us in our ſadneſs, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports us in our faintings, and guides us in our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I may ſay as <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people, <hi>Deut. 33. 29. happy art thou O Iſrael, who is like unto thee, O people ſaved by the Lord?</hi> and as David,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170103:40"/>
Pſal. 33. 12. <hi>Bleſſed is that Nation whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By faith we look at Chriſt, as having all fulneſs of grace in himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. &amp; <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. all other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints have but their meaſure, ſome more, ſome leſs, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7. but Chriſt hath received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not by meaſure, but in the fulneſs of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34.</p>
                  <p>Now whatſoever fulneſs of grace there is in Chriſt, he hath received not for himſelf, but for us, that he might communicate unto us, and we might receive from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. it is ſaid he received gifts for men; not for himſelf, but for men, that we might receive from him; and thence it is, that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. of his fulneſs we receive grace for grace, his wiſdom is to make us wiſe, his meekneſs and patience, is to make us meek and patient, and Chriſt is faithfull to diſtribute to us all ſuch graces that he hath received for us, he is faithfull in all his houſe: what ſhall I ſay more in this Covenant, God unboſoms himſelf unto us, and ſhines forth upon us, and there is now and then a ſweet entercourſe of love between him and thy ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the bleſſing of this Covenant there is remedy for every malady, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſutable to every condition, for being and well being, for this life, and that which is to come.

                  <head>The twelfth thing to be enquired into, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> notwithſtanding this bleſſed Covenant of grace contained in the Goſpel, whether moſt men and women in the world be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Covenant of works.</head>
                  <p>THE Covenant of works remains in full force and vertue, to all unbelievers, <hi>Rom. 10. 4. For Chriſt is the end of the Law, for righteouſneſs, to none but to thoſe that believe.</hi> Oh, did we but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the miſery of all ſuch as are under the Law, it might awaken us. He that is under the Law, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Covenant of works, and they muſt come and ſtand before God the Judge of all, and have their ſins ſet in order before him, and the Law paſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon them, and their own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces terrifying them, and there ſhall be none to plead for them, or to ſtand betwixt Gods warth and them; but they ſhall be left to themſelves, to die and periſh in their ſins: this Covenant hath no Mediator; for then Chriſt hath not a word to ſpeak for them, he telsſuch, <hi>John 17. 19. he prayeth not for them,</hi> he pleads only for them that fly to grace, and take hold of that Covenant; but as for all others they have God againſt them, the Law againſt them, they have all creatures to accuſe them, and to teſtifie againſt them; but have no Chriſt, no Mediator to appear for them, and there ſhall be no grace ſhewed, but ſtrict Juſtice without any mercy: Oh that ſuch would bethink themſelves, what a God they muſt meet withall, even a juſt God, a God of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170103:41"/>
a God of vengeance, that will not ſpare their miſdeeds, what ever Juſtice can require of them they muſt ſatisfie to the uttmoſt farthing; there will be Juſtice without mercy. Oh when nothing but Juſtice ſhall judge you, who can ſtand, what fleſh may abide it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 5. A wicked man hath no true right before God, unto the good things of this life, for if any ſay they have, I ask by what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? is it by the Covenant of works? then they muſt fulfill it, which they do not, nor can do; is it then by the Covenant of grace? but they are not within that Covenant, they are within the Covenant of works, but cannot fulfill it; they are without the Covenant of grace, and therefore they can claim nothing by it; again, faith and holineſs can no more be ſeparated, then light can be ſeparated from the Sun. Such as lay claim to the Covenant of grace, and yet live looſly, carnally, unconſcionably, they do but deceive themſelves, they may be in Covenant with hell and death, but have no part in the Covenant of life and peace, <hi>John 5. 45.

               <head>Of Juſtification by Grace.</head>
               <p>THE queſtion is not ſo much about the time, and terms, and matter of our Juſtification, but how we are made righteous in the ſight of God, which the Scriptures do affirm, to be by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone, which God doth impute to all his ſeed freely, without works and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions performed by us.</p>
               <p>1. Conſider if the righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified, be a perfect righteouſneſs, then we are not juſtified by our obedience to Goſpel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, but the righteouſneſs whereby we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, is a perfect righteouſneſs, which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt alone, <hi>Heb. 1. 8. Mat. 6. 33. Rom. 4. 6. and everlaſting righteouſneſs, Pſal. 119. 142. Pſal. 22. 31. &amp;</hi> 35. 28. that righteouſneſs which juſtifieth us before God, as it is not ours, ſo it is not in us.</p>
               <p>But as it is Chriſts righteouſneſs, ſo it is in him, <hi>In me you ſhall have righteouſneſs and ſtrength, Pſal. 71. 15, 16, 19, 24. I will make mention of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, even of thine only.</hi> Juſtice and mercy do both meet in this Juſtification; Juſtice, in that he will not juſtifie a ſinner, without a perfect righteouſneſs; and yet mercy, in that he will accept him for ſuch a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that is, neither in him, nor done by him, but by his ſurety for him.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider the Apoſtles all along were very carefullto keep this Doctrine of Juſtification by grace diſtinct from all other things, they all along do oppoſe the Law and grace, works and faith,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170103:42"/>
our righteouſneſs and Chriſts righteouſneſs, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us thereby how needfull it is they ſhould be kept aſunder.</p>
               <p>Juſtification by grace hath been and will be the bone of contention till the next coming of Chriſt: why ſo? becauſe learning cannot reach it, naturall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is confounded at it, evill Angels do not know it, moſt men do perſecute it, as being bereaved of the knowledge of it, or elſe corrupt in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of it.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts ſay, if we be freely juſtified by grace, we need not do any good works, and if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall from grace, we need not fear to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin.</p>
               <p>And they hold that we are not juſtified by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, but by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt inherent in us, and righteous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done by us.</p>
               <p>3. Conſider we ſhould not be juſtified by grace, if any condition were required of us, in order to our juſtification; for the condition whenſoever perſorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes the Covenant a due debt; then juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould not be of grace, but of debt, contrary to the expreſs words of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>4. Conſider the nature and cauſe of juſtification more particularly, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Juſtification, is when God meerly of his own grace and free will, forgiveth our ſins, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us juſt and innocent.</p>
               <p>Though Gods Law was by us violated, we are abſolved from ſin and puniſhment by the grace of God, and merits of Chriſt apprehended by faith: and ſo by him all that believe are juſtified in all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170103:43"/>
things, in which they could not be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes, Act.</hi> 13. 39. Juſtification is an act undivided, and all at once, and ſo it differs from ſanctification, which is done by degrees; all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent eminent acts, as juſtification, ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, renovation, are but one act in God. I ſhall cloſe up what I have to ſay to this thing, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the reader ſeriouſly to conſider theſe precious Scriptures, all ſpeaking to the ſame thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Now to him that workoth not, but beleiveth on him that juſtifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteouſneſs. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us. Rom.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>And if By grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace.</hi>

               <p>So having ſpoken to the nature of juſtification, give me leave alſo to lay down the uſefulneſs of it as to us, and the benefits every beleiver have by it, the greateſt thing that we can deſire (next the glory of God) is our own ſalvation, and the ſweeteſt thing we can here obtain, is the aſſurance of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In this life we cannot get higher then to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of that which in the next life is to be enjoyed; all godly people ſhall enjoy a Heaven when they leave this earth; ſome enjoy a Heaven whilſt they are here on earth; that Chriſtians may enjoy two Heavens, let them enquire after, diligently ſeek for, and cheerfully embrace this Doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, freely and only by the grace of God, as the cauſe, through Chriſt as the way, the Holy-Ghoſt as the worker and evidencer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Doctrine is as the foundation and baſis of all Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:170103:43"/>2. This Doctrine is the inlet of all ſpirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine peace and conſolation.</p>

               <p n="6">6. This is the great Doctrine by which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans kingdom is undermined and overthrown.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This is the Doctrine that Satan doth moſt war againſt, either to pervert or corrupt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This Doctrine is the moſt hardeſt piece to be learned, it being wholly ſupernaturall in every part of it, above the reach of nature, and all things in us do oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>1. This Doctrine is the foundation and baſis of all Chriſtian Religion, as doth clearly appear by theſe ſeverall inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin at the bottom, our Election is the Election of grace, and according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Vocation is according to his grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, given us in Chriſt, before the world began.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If any ask what is the nature of this free grace? I anſwer, grace in its proper notion ſignifies that free goodneſs, favour or good will, whereby God is moved to open the eyes of the blind mind, and to let him know the love of God that paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If any ask why the Doctrine of the Goſpel is called by the name of grace? I anſwer, becauſe it was only Gods free good will, to beſtow it upon thoſe that did moſt want it. If any ask farther, why this free grace was ever beſtowed at all? or why one age or place of the world ſhould receive is rather then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? or why God ſhould diſcover this great miſterie, was kept ſecret ſince the world began, to thoſe who were ſinners of the Gentiles, who ſerved dumb Idols? or why God ſhould be found of them that ſought him not, or be made manifeſt to thoſe that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not after him? I can give no other anſwer then that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence,</hi> or that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 35, 26. <hi>Even ſo Father, becauſe it ſeemeth good in thy ſight.</hi>

               <p>2. This Doctrine is the inlet of all ſpirituall divine peace to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>There is a vein through which this peace that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth underſtanding, is conveyed to the ſoul, which the men and women of the world know not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 8. <hi>The way of peace they know not; they have made to themſelves crooked paths, whoſoever goeth therein ſhall not find peace, Rom.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>the way of peace have they not known:</hi> in a word, no man or woman under heaven can know the way to this peace, untill the Lord give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide their feet into the way of peace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 79.</p>
               <p>No man can receive, retain and enjoy this peace of God unleſs he wait on God at the ſprings of peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſpring of peace is faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>being juſtified by Faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> faith ſeeth Chriſt to be our peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>and from him freely given to us, John.</hi> 14. 27. and the vein through which it runs to the ſoul, is the vein of faith; laying hold on, and applying of the free grace of God to the ſoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond way of peace, is this, a man muſt not only know it, where it is, and believe it, but he muſt ſtay himſelf wholly upon God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant expectation of the increaſe and ſupply of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe heart is ſtayed on thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:170103:45"/>3. The next vein or ſpring of peace, ariſeth from a ſouls reſting ſatisfied in Chriſts righteouſneſs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nothing to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 15, 16, 19, 24. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 142. <hi>I will make mention of thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even of thine only, for thy righteouſneſs is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs,</hi> See Jer. 33. 16. the perfection of Chriſts righteouſneſs is held forth unto us, and alwayes lieth before us, that we may be thankfull for it, and peaceable with it, and rejoyce in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtower of it; the Lord Jeſus having ſpoken peace to the ſoul, and acquainted the ſoul that he hath paid all his debts for it, and that his ſins which were ſo many ſhall be remembred no more, then the ſoul begins to be filled with joy and peace, in beleiving, beholding, and enjoying Chriſts righieouſneſs, which begets in the ſoul, a perfect peace, a precious peace, a full and compleat peace, and an everlaſting peace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next vein through which peace is conveyed to the ſoul, is by our acquainting our ſelves with him, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at peace thereby, ſo good ſhall come unto thee;</hi> now by thy acquainting thy ſelf with him, theſe things will fall in. Firſt, thou wilt ſee that thou waſt caſt out to the loathing of thy ſoul, and no eye pittying thee, much leſs to relieve thee; that then, even then, when man was ready to periſh, ſhould be the time of love with God, whereby he caſt his skirt of compaſſion over him, and ſaid unto him again, live. Oh ye Heavens ſtand amazed! and oh thou earth, fleſh and blood rejoyce and triumph, for when there was no eye to pitty thee, the arm of the Lord hath brought ſalvation, by raiſing up a mighty one out of the houſe of his ſervant <hi>David,</hi> even Chriſt the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170103:45"/>
Lord, the wondefull Counſellor, the mighty God, mighty to ſave, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace, who became man under the Law, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obedience; and not only ſo, but alſo became our Surety for us; to do, ſuffer and fulfill that for us, which we were no waies able to do for our ſelves.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of works reſted in and truſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, can never work ſettled comfort, and peace, and quietneſs of heart; let a man walk as exactly as ever fleſh and blood can attain unto, let him as confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly build on this foundation as he poſſibly may, yet the heart will be ſtill in ſuſpition, in doubt, in fear, uncertain what to truſt unto, but the Doctrine of grace reſted in and truſted unto, doth ſettle a ſoul in peace, this is a ſure Anchor for the ſoul to reſt upon, let waves ſwell, and winds blow, he retains a firm peace, ſtand here and we are ſafe for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, This Doctrine is the Root and Spring of all Goſpel obedience, whatſoever men call obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if it ariſeth not from hence, it is but forced and legal; we muſt get up Goſpel principles, if we would keep up Goſpel practiſes.</p>
               <p>Whereſoever this Doctrine of grace is received and retained in the love and power of it, it works theſe five things in the ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, Love, Fear, Willingneſs and Chearfulneſs, and from theſe five things, as from five Springs, doth all Goſpel obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ariſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. True obedience doth flow from Faith; hence it is called the obedience of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. in the latter part of this Chapter we read of a myſterie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170103:46"/>
revealed, and what that myſterie was, it was the Doctrine of Gods grace; and the end why it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, was for the Obedience of Faith, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Faith in Chriſt doth put the ſoul upon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual actings, ſo alſo love conſtrains them in whom it is, to keep the Lords command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21, 23. compared with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 26. 3, 4. <hi>If ye love me, keep my commandments: For thy loving kindneſs is before mine eyes,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, and I have walked in thy truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As true obedience doth ſpring from Faith and Love, ſo it is attended with an holy fear, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 161. My heart, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> doth ſtand in awe of thy word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>Noah</hi> being warned of God, touching things not ſeen, was moved with fear, and ſo prepared an Ark.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As Goſpel obedience doth ſpring from Faith; Love and Fear, ſo it ariſeth from a willing mind, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27. 8. when thou ſaidſt, ſeek ye my face, my heart anſwered, Lord thy face will I ſeek; as <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, O Lord it is thy great command, (ſeek ye my face) my heart ſaith unto thee, it is the deſire of my ſoul, thy command is become my requeſt, thy face Lord will I ſeek.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As Goſpel-obedience ſprings from Faith, Love and fear, and a willing mind; ſo it is performed chearfully, and delightfully, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. <hi>I delight to do thy will O God, thy Law is in my heart, as well as in thy Book.</hi> What ſhall I ſay more, a ſoul receiving, believing, retaining and ſtanding in the true grace of God, ſhall be every way furniſhed and ſupplyed with ſtrength to perform any duty, to exerciſe any
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170103:46"/>
grace, to ſubdue any luſt, to reſiſt, any temptation, to bear any affliction. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sure, if the bowels of mercy do not melt, win and draw us, Juſtice will be a ſwift witneſs againſt us: And <hi>as the Branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine,</hi> John 15. 4. <hi>no more can ye, except ye abide in me:</hi> Gods free love manifeſted to us, and by his Spirit ſhed abroad in us, is the cauſe of our love to him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 10, 19. And our love to him is the cauſe of our obeying him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 3. <hi>&amp; John</hi> 14. 15, 21, 23. we read in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 19. <hi>After that I was turned, I repented, and after that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh.</hi> That is as if he had ſaid, after that thou haſt wrought a gracious change upon my ſoul, by thine afflicting hand, out of thy love to me, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
               <p>Or after I came to my ſelf again, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17 and conſidered ſeriouſly with my ſelf how it was with me, I was touched with repentance, with ſorrow, and with ſhame for my former miſcariages.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly this Doctrine received, and the heart therein eſtabliſhed, will be a ſtop and bar to keep out all floods of errour.</p>
               <p>The floods of all errour flow in at the pipe of ignorance, and eſpecially ignorance of this very thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrine of grace; the errour of the Papiſts of building and reſting upon works, ſprings from their ignorance of this bleſſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crtine; the errour of the Quaker ſprings purely from hence; the errour of the Arminian ſprings in at the ſame pipe, partly by works, and partly by grace; they not ſeeking ſalvation by grace, but as it were by the, works of the Law, they ſtumbled and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170103:47"/>
fell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 32. And all the unſtability, formality, legality that there is at this day appearing amongſt the Presbyterian, Independant and Baptiſt, or any other people profeſſing godlineſs, doth ariſe from their ignorance or their little knowledge in this great myſterie; nay farther, did you ever read, or from any true Chriſtian hear, that any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was acquainted with, and in ſome good meaſure eſtabliſhed in (this Doctrine of grace) infected with, and overcome by theſe floods of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that doth now ſwarm among us? Oh how doth Satan pollute and defile the ſouls and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, with Chriſt-diſhonouring and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undoing opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ordinances of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are poor, carnal, low things; wholly denying ſome, and ſlighting the reſt, ſaying, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are not the Word of God, nor the ground of Faith, nor the Rule of life, nor a true Judge in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and controverſies, alſo denying interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and expoſitions of the Word, which is,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Firſt, By God commanded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1.</item>
                  <item>2. This was practiſed by the godly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 23.</item>
                  <item>3. This is profitable for the unfolding of obſcure places, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 8.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now theſe and the like things the Lord in his Word doth call ungodlineſs, becauſe it in part or in whole denies what he hath commanded, and opens a door for men to do the contrary. Now for a remedy herein, let every Chriſtian ſtudy, pray and enquire for, and ſtand in the grace of God: See that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed place, 1 <hi>Peter 5. 12. Exhorting and teſtifying
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170103:47"/>
that it is the true grace of God in which ye ſtand, or wherein ye ſtand:</hi> Agreeable is this text to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Rom. 5. 2. By whom we have acceſs by Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this grace wherein we ſtand:</hi> now their ſtanding in this grace, did fence them from all falſe doctrines and erronious opinions.</p>
               <p>Papiſts and Arminians, which hold a falling away from grace, know not the difference between the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace; their errour is this, they teach as a principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that thoſe that are adopted, ſanctified and planted into Chriſt may fall away and periſh; this Doctrine is contrary to the whole tenor of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, injurious unto God, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable unto the Saints: it would ſhake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Gods election, if thoſe that are once ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſhould fall away and periſh, for thoſe only whom he knew before, thoſe only doth he ſanctifie; now if he hath in mercy drawn us to himſelf, it is a ſign he hath loved us from everlaſting, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 3. our calling and ſanctification is according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Rom. 8. 28, 30. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 9. and thoſe that are ſanctified, juſtified and called, are all firſt choſen, and thence faith is called the Faith of Gods elect, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. And thoſe that are ſanctified, are ſaid to be choſen unto it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4. ſo that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods election ſtandeth ſure, and ſo our ſtate in Grace is ſure alſo, as being built on that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which cannot be removed, and this doth Chriſt make good in that ſpeech of his, <hi>Mat,</hi> 24. where ſpeaking of the ſtrong deluſions which many ſhould be deceived withall, he ſaith, <hi>that thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers ſhould ſhew forth ſuch ſigns and wonders, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170103:48"/>
if it were poſſible they ſhould deceive the very elect: (if it were poſſible)</hi> but that they cannot do, the elect cannot periſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. This Doctrine is the main ſupport of a ſoul under all tryals; when all things fail, Gods grace and free love doth never fail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will not leave thee, nor forſake thee, ſaith the Lord, Heb.</hi> 13. 5. compared with <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1. 5.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Our neareſt and deareſt friends may fail, <hi>Job 19. 14. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our eyes may fail, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 123. mine eyes fail for thy ſalvation, and for the word of thy righteouſneſs.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Our ſtrength may fail, <hi>Pſal. 31. 10. My ſtrength faileth becauſe of mine iniquity.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But now ſaith the Lord, although the labour of the Olive may fail, and thy neareſt and deareſt friends fail, and thine eyes fail, and thy tongue fail, thy ſtrength fail, and fleſh and heart fail, yet I will be with thee, I will never fail thee, as thou mayſt ſee, by what I have left written for thy learning in theſe following Scriptures, <hi>Joſh. 1. 5. Joſh. 21. 45. &amp; 23. 14. 1 King. 8. 56. Heb.</hi> 13. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:170103:48"/>Yea, ſearch the whole Scripture, and enquire of all the Saints, whether I did ever fail any one ſoul, that did put his truſt in me; thus thou mayeſt ſee, that a Believer is bleſſed, only in a help without him, not within, and all his aſſurance, confidence and comfort doth flow to him from the fountain of free-grace, through the channel of faith, and not of works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving himſelf happy for what another (even Chriſt) hath done for him; not for what he hath done or can do; the joy of a Believer would alwaies be unſpeakable, did he alwaies apprehend his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in and by Chriſt alone. In a word, the pure, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, matchleſs and ſpotleſs righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a ſouls righteouſneſs and reſting place, when the ſoul finds that he wanders no more from mountain to hill, as formerly he did. Whoever you are that read theſe lines, ſearch whether you are gotten into this reſt, if not, with all ſpeed get into this reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, for Satan is walking about as a roaring Lyon, and though he cannot rob a Chriſtian of his Crown, yet he will do what he can to rob him of his comfort and peace, to make his life a burden, and an hell to him, to cauſe him to ſpend his daies in ſorrow and mourning, ſighing and complaining, in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and queſtioning, ſaying in theſe or the like words, ſurely I have no intereſt in Chriſt, my graces are not true, my hope is but the hope of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, my confidence is but preſumption, and my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are but deluſions.</p>
               <p>Then when a ſoul is thus beweldred and troubled, the Lord many times diſcovers his free grace and love, and that expells ignorance, and ſlayeth the ſouls enemies, and by this love the Lord draweth

               <p>6. This Doctrine is that by which Satan is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and his Kingdom turned up ſide down.</p>
               <p>So that being a Reprobate and a fallen Angel, maketh it his great work to bring all that poſſibly he can into the ſame ſtate with him, although through this grace of God, he can do nothing but by permſſiion, God doth keep him in a powerſul chain, wicked Angels are Potent, only our good God is omnipotent; when he doth give way, one Devil doth overthrow a Legion, a million of men; but till God doth lengthen out his chain, a Legion of Devils cannot hurt one man: Satan cannot hurt us, unleſs he get us within the compaſs of his chain, if we go not to him, he cannot come to us.

in us. All the forces of hell cannot ſcale the walls of heaven. Its true, Satan will ſometimes ſtand up, as the Philiſtian did, and ſay, Who is the man that will redeem this and that ſoul that are in my ſnare, and in my power; am not I the God of this world, and is it not written that I am the Prince of the air, who ſhall reſcue them out of my hand? then cometh the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> againſt the Philiſtian, and ſaith to Satan, thou haſt defied the Armies of Iſrael, I will try thy power, and pull down thy pride; here Chriſt hath a ſingle duel with them, and the iſſue was, that Satan bruiſed the heel of Chriſt, and Chriſt wounded his head, and ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled that Propheſie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And ſo Chtiſt after he wounded his head caſt him out, <hi>John</hi> 12. 31. The Prince of this world is caſt out, ſo that now Satans power is already taken away, the Devil, it is true, doth challenge a right to many of Chriſt ſervants, till they are called, converted and brought from under the power of darkneſs, by the appearance of this free grace, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 4, 5. But after the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour appeared, according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he ſaved us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy-Ghoſt; it was Satan that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted our firſt parents to rebell; it was Satan that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <hi>David</hi> to number People: it was Satan that put <hi>Peter</hi> upon perſwading of Chriſt not to ſuffer: it was Satan that put <hi>Cain</hi> upon murthering <hi>Abel,</hi> therefore he is called a Murtherer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; it was Satan that put treaſon into the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> againſt Chriſt; it was Satan that put <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi> upon lying.

               <p>It was not <hi>Davids</hi> ſling nor his ſtone that gave him the advantage of ſetting his feet upon <hi>Goliah,</hi> but his faith in the free grace of God, 1 <hi>Sam. 17. 45.

This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. This is the Doctrine that Satan doth make war againſt, either to pervert or corrupt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſeeks to pervert it by putting out of order, or turning up-ſide-down, to bring in that which ſhould be kept out, <hi>Prov. 10. 9. He that perverteth his way ſhall be known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If he cannot prevail with men to pervert this Doctrine, he ſhall leave no means unattempted, no ſtone unturned to corrupt it, by keeping people in a fooliſh unſound perſwaſion, that all is well with them, <hi>Pſalm 143. They are all corrupt;</hi> that is, they have not underſtanding to perceive the things which God offereth to them.</p>
               <p>There be two main things in which Satan doth buſie himſelf to deceive ſouls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By laying the greatneſs and vileneſs of a mans ſins before him, and then falls to perſwade
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170103:50"/>
him there is no mercy in God for ſuch a ſinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By preſenting God to the ſoul as one made up all of mercy.</p>
               <p>1. By laying the greatneſs and vileneſs of ones ſins before him, and then perſwades him, there is no mercy in God for ſuch a ſinner: What ſaith Satan, doſt thou think that ever thou ſhalt attain mercy by Chriſt, that haſt ſinned with ſo high an hand in ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tenders of grace, and grieved the Spirit of grace, and deſpiſed the Word of grace, that haſt trampled under foot the blood of Chriſt, by which thou mighteſt have been pardoned, purged, juſtified and ſaved? What doſt thou think, ſaith Satan, that ever Chriſt will own, receive or embrace ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy wretch as thou art? Thou art unworthy to entertain Chriſt in thy houſe, much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to entertain him in thy heart; thou fool, thou knoweſt thou art not prepared, thou art not thus and thus humbled, thou art not heart ſick of ſin, thou haſt not been under horrors and terrors, as ſuch a man and ſuch a woman, thou muſt ſtay till thou art prepared, and qualified to receive Chriſt; for albeit Chriſt is able, yet he is not willing to ſave ſuch a rebell as thou art, that haſt been in open Rebellion againſt him all thy daies: now for anſwer hereunto.</p>
               <p>That there is mercy for ſuch miſerable creatures, if they will receive it, and not diſpair, will more at large appear in theſe choice places of Scripture, <hi>Micah 7. 18, 19. Iſa. 43. 25. Jer. 3. 12. Joel 2. 13. Iſa. 55. 7. 1 Tim. 1. 13, 15. Pſalm 66. 18. Iohn 6. 37. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. Heb. 7. 25. Iſa.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:170103:51"/>It is hard to find any one place in the whole Book of God, requiring any worthineſs in the creature, before a ſouls believing in Chriſt, and reſting upon him for happineſs and bleſſedneſs; I read of none that obtained mercy and pardon from Chriſt but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſouls; pray what worthineſs was in <hi>Zachens, Mary Magdalen, Paul</hi> and <hi>Lydia</hi> before their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and believing in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. If Satan cannot catch men in this firſt pit, then he turns over leaf and comes a new way to work, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> by preſenting God to the ſoul as one made up all of mercy; Oh ſaith Satan, you need not make ſuch a matter of ſin, nor to be ſo unwilling to ſin, for God is a God of mercy, a God that delighteth in mercy, ready to ſhew mecry, a God that is never weary of ſhewing mercy, he is a God more prone to pardon his people, then to puniſh them, and why then ſhould you make ſuch a matter of ſin? by this Satan doth cauſe many a ſoul to turn the grace of God into wantonneſs; but for a remedy herein, conſider that God is as juſt as he is merciful, as the Scripture doth ſpeak him out to be, a very merciful God, ſo they ſpeak him forth to be a very juſt God, witneſs his caſting the Angels out of heaven, his turning Father <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, his drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old world, his raining fire out of heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sodom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, his general mercy is over all his works, but his ſpecial mercy is confined to thoſe that he hath divinely qualified, <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7. Pſal. 32. 10. Pſal.</hi> 103. 11.</p>
               <p>8. This Doctrine is the moſt hardeſt thing in the world to be learned, it being wholly in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170103:51"/>
every part of it ſupernatural, and all things in us do fight againſt it.</p>
               <p>To do well and have well is natural, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and have well is ſupernatural; man remaining in his natural ſtate, is altogether unable to receive and comprehend thoſe glorious and gracious myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of being righteous by anothers righteouſneſs, and of being ſaved by anothers ſuffering; all men both Jews and Gentiles are ſet upon ſeeking life and happineſs by their own doings and performances; for although man did fearfully fall by tranſgreſſion, yet he retained certain foot-ſteps, marks and impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of that moral and eternal Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was at firſt engraven in his heart, by the finger of God Almighty. So that although as to everlaſting felicity man is dark and dead, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the God of this world, whoſe Kingdom is a Kingdom of darkneſs, who rules in men by ignorance, yet there remains in every man ſo much light as doth lead him to the knowledge of a God; but when the Lord doth reveal this myſterie of his grace by his Spirit to and in man, then he doth over and above that common work of the Spirit, by which he enlighteneth every man; I ſay, Chriſt doth give unto thoſe given him of the Father, the mind and underſtanding to know him and to receive him, and to lay hold on him, for life and ſalvation. Now in this ſenſe the natural man perceiveth not the things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 21. The world by wiſdom knoweth not God,</hi> &amp;c. Now this Doctrine of grace is the hardeſt thing in the world to be learned, becauſe we are naturally apt to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170103:52"/>
hunger and thirſt after a righteouſneſs of our own, but it muſt be renounced; I confeſs this ſelf denyal is very hard: Oh how hard is it for the ſoul to be taken off its own bottom of works and qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to ſtrip them of all that is their own! ye take away their lives, they muſt and will have ſomething; ſome humbleneſs and brokenneſs of heart, ſome tears, ſome good works or abilities, or good heart, as many ſay; and this doth argue as yet thou art not pluckt off thine own ſtock, and therefore art not planted into Chriſt; thou art igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the righteouſneſs of God, and ſo goeſt about to eſtabliſh thine own righteouſneſs; conſider, conſider our works make us not the better before God, neither the more beloved of the Lord, but declare us to be what we are made by God, and ſo are profitable to men, but not to God.</p>
               <p>But what ſaith the Scripture? now to him that worketh is not the reward reckoned of grace but of debt; but to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>We are ſaved, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Again, we read, <hi>Rom. 5. 10. When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> Iſa. 43. 25. <hi>I will blot out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins; a new heart alſo will I give thee,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26, 27, 31. Again, <hi>Iſa. 57. 18. I have ſeen his waies and will heal him,</hi> Iſa. 44. 22. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions, return to me, for I have redeemed thee,</hi> Ezek. 16. 6, 8. <hi>When thou waſt polluted in thy own
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170103:52"/>
blood, I ſaid unto thee live; when thou waſt in thy blood, thy time was the time of love: and I covered thy nakedneſs.</hi> Now conſider the Lord doth this that he might have all the glory of our Election, Vocation, Juſtification, Sanctification and Salvation. See <hi>Eph. 1. 6. Jer. 9. 24. Rom. 3. 9. Luke 1. 74. 1 Cor. 4. 7. Iames</hi> 1. 17. And as this Doctrine is the hardeſt thing in the whole world to be learned, ſo it is the hardeſt work (where it is not learned) to obey God in any of his commands; to inſtance in one for all, God doth command men every where to repent: but is not repentance a mighty work, a difficult work, a work that is above our power? Surely there is no power below that power that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and that made the world, that can break the heart of a ſinner, or turn his heart. It is as eaſie to turn the ſtream that runs ſwiftly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and make it run as ſwiftly backward, as it is to repent indeed, and to melt thine own heart; it is as eaſie to turn a flint into fleſh, as to turn thine own heart to the Lord; it is as eaſie to raiſe the dead, and make a world, as to repent; it is a flower that grows not in natures Garden, <hi>Jer. 13. 23. Can the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this work that is ſo difficult, and ſo hard, above our reach, is eaſily wrought in the ſoul, when God gives it to ſee his grace and love in giving Chriſt, <hi>Act. 5. 31. Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. If I or any other, or an Angel of heaven preach any
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170103:53"/>
other Goſpel then this, that we have preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, then ſalvation and participation of Chriſt by grace, and free gift, for that is the Doctrine he had eſtabliſhed, before and through the whole Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians:</hi> What ſhall I ſay more? there is nothing in men, though never ſo vile, that can debar a perſon or a people from a part in this Chriſt; ſome will not have Chriſt except they can pay for him, others dare not meddle with Chriſt, becauſe they are ſo vile and ſinful, and therefore they ſeek to get an inherent righteouſneſs, they run to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, to their prayers, to their tears, to their humiliations, and ſorrows, and reformations, and will not come at Chriſt untill they have ſpent all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Phyſitians, and are ſenſible with the woman in the Goſpel, that they are nothing the better, but the worſe; then they begin to think of the back parts of Chriſt, and wait for a time to come behind him in a throng, that they may not be ſeen to touch the hem of his garment.</p>
               <p>You know when a pump is drie, men uſe to fetch a Bucket of water, and pour it into the dry pump, and then they fall to pumping, and by vertue of the water poured in, there comes more water up, and by continual pumping they fetch out abundance: So our hearts many times are dry, there is no ſap, no moiſture, no life: the vertues of Chriſt muſt firſt be poured in, before you can get any thing out. Wherefore ſtand we labouring and tugging in vain? O ſtay no longer, go to Chriſt, it is he that muſt break thy rocky heart: in a word, we muſt conſider Chriſt as freely given us by the Father, before we can believe the life of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170103:53"/>This Doctrine ſpeaks out with open mouth the exceeding freeneſs and riches of Gods grace, as will appear, if we conſider;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God is firſt in ſeeking after us, to draw us into Covenant with himſelf; we ſeek not him, but he ſeeks us; we chuſe not him, but he chuſeth us; we wait not on him, he waits to be gracious to us: we beſeech not him, he doth beſeech us to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20. John</hi> 15. 16. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19. So that he is found of them that ſeek not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, becauſe he firſt reveals and offers himſelf in mercy to us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, the time wherein the Lord doth ſeek to us, and take us by the hand, to bring us into Covenant with him, and then we ſhall find, that when we are moſt averſe and backward, and have leaſt thought of ſeeking after him, then it is that he ſeeks us: thus the Lord called <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was perſecuting, raging, and breathing out ſlaughter againſt the Lord, and againſt his Saints; then the Lord takes him by the hand, and enters into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and ſo it was with thoſe mockers, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 13, 37. Here were no diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and preparations on their part, but free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected grace from God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Compare thoſe that are taken into Covenant, with thoſe that are left out, for all are not taken in, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. And this alſo will make it manifeſt it is Free grace by which any are taken in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22, 23. We have all ſinned, and there is no difference; no reaſon therefore—in us, why one is taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant, and not another, but only free grace in God, God owes nothing to any man: he may
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170103:54"/>
truly ſay to all, I do thee no wrong, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 13. Thou haſt as much as I owe thee. So then it muſt needs be free grace to thoſe that are taken in: apply <hi>John 14. 21. Mat.</hi> 11. 5, 25. Nay ſometimes God chuſeth the worſt, and takes in the moſt unworthy, and leaves thoſe that are better then they, <hi>viz. Paul</hi> a chief of ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. Publicans and Harlots, <hi>Mat. 21. Mary Magdalen</hi> poſſeſt with ſeven Devils: theſe were taken in, and the righteous generation, as they were reputed, which juſtified themſelves, and were juſtified by others, were left and paſſed by. The reaſons why the Lord would have his Covenant to ſtand upon this foundation of free grace are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be a ground of hope, to ſuch as ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of acceptance with God, if the grace of the Covenant were not free, ſuch unworthy ones could have no hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the glory of grace to be freely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Come and buy without mony,</hi> it darkens the glory of grace, to have it beſtowed upon worthy ones. <hi>Be it known unto you ſaith the Lord, not for your ſakes I beſtow this, but for my own names ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That vain man may not boaſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That our mercies and bleſſings may be ſure to us, <hi>Rom. 4. 16. Our ſalvation is by grace, to the end that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying thereby, that if it depended never ſo little upon works, we could not be ſo ſure of it.</p>
               <p>Oh the rich mercy, the great love, exceeding riches of his grace, great goodneſs, tender love, great mercy, multitude of loving kindneſſes. <hi>Oh then not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name be the praiſe, it is enough for us that we have life,</hi> let grace
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170103:54"/>
alone have all the praiſe and glory, and let every one that readeth theſe lines, endeavour to imitate this free grace of God, which is ſhewed to us. Firſt, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord, not for his gifts and rewards, but with a free love, as he hath loved us, and ſerving him with a free ſpirit, and a willing mind. Secondly, Let us be free in doing good unto all men, even to ſuch as have deſerved nothing, though they be aliens and ſtrangers, and ſuch as we never hope to receive any good from, yet freely to do them good, even where we look for nothing again, as God hath done to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 12, 14.</p>
               <p>10. As this Covenant and grace is free, ſo it is ſure and certain to be performed, it cannot, it will not fail thoſe that reſt upon it.</p>
               <p>The Covenant and promiſe of grace, are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the unchangable purpoſe of God, which is a foundation remaining ſure, and cannot be ſhaken, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.

The Lord is ſaid to have promiſed eternal life, before the world began.</p>
               <p>So then it is free, and it is ſure, and the freeneſs of it doth prove the ſureneſs of it, it is free that it might be ſure; ſo here it is ſure becauſe it is free; nothing can hinder free grace from giving eternal life to whom it will. So that the accompliſhment will eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way anſwer their expectation and hope, thus ſaid <hi>David, 2. Sam.</hi> 23. 5.

               <p>The ſtability of grace is compared to the firmneſs and unmoveableneſs of the mighty mountains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 19 And to the unvariable courſe of the day and night, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 20. So that it is as ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. There is a ſpiritual, or ſupernatural principle, from which Chriſtians do or ſhould act: now the right ground or principle, from which all holy and righteous actions ſhould flow, is either from</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2.

He did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart: And ſo much to the firſt of theſe, the principle from which we ſhould act.</p>
                  <p>2. We muſt act by a right rule. Some make their own wils their rule, others make the example of men their rule, others make the light within their rule, but we are to make the word of God our rule, and ſo to go forth by the footſteps of the flock, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                  <p>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be upon them, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 16. And again the Apoſtles tell us, from Chriſt, whoſe mouth they are, we ought ſo to walk as we have them for an example.</p>
                  <p>And he that walks or ſpeaks not according to this rule, it is becauſe he hath no light in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20.</p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Noahs</hi> rule, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 7. and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> rule, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 17. and <hi>Davids, Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. and <hi>Pauls, Rom.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
                  <p>The Lord doth not bid us make the light within the rule, but he hath placed a light within us, to ſee the rule without us, which will appear, if we a little conſider, that there is a threefold illumination.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:170103:58"/>1. General and natural, which is a natural light, or a light of reaſon; and with this light, the eternal word, the Son of God hath enlightned every man that cometh into the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a ſpecial and ſupernatural light which is planted in the ſouls of thoſe whom he hath before time elected, and in time called. See <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 19. and have put on the new man which is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in knowledge, after the Image of him that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a kind of a middle illumination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, more then meerly natural, but leſs then truly ſupernatural, which is the common gift of the ſpirit, even to hypocrites: <hi>Judas</hi> was thus enlightned, and thoſe hypocrites we read of in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. and <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. 13. and by means of this light they may attain to theſe five things, and yet periſh at laſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They may attain to a great meaſure of literal knowledge of Chriſt, of the truth, and of the way of righteouſneſs, as doth clearly appear by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. If we ſin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They may by means of this knowledge, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to great degrees of reformation in their life and waies, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. For if after they have eſcaped the pollution of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein and overcome, the latter end with them is worſe then the beginning, for they were only outwardly reformed in the ſight of men,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170103:59"/>
but not inwardly renewed in the ſight of God. Sin may be chained up and reſtrained, yet not caſt out and mortified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They may go ſo far as to taſte of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. Note, here the Holy Ghoſt doth not ſay of them as of true Saints, they have eaten or drunken, but only taſted, that is, they have had ſome kind of Reliſh or ſmall ſenſe, by a temporary Faith, of the excellencies of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They may be ſaid by the improvement of this light, to be partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. that is, they are made partakers of the common gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, as common illumination, hyſtorical faith, and faith of Miracles. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They may in a ſenſe be ſaid to have taſted the good word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5. for theſe men hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel powerfully preached, and the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs love of God in Chriſt to ſinners diſplayed, the worth and excellency of Jeſus Chriſt and his benefits unfolded, they come to be ſometimes moved, pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for preſent affected with ſome pangs and moods of joy. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John-Baptiſt</hi> glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Mar. 6. 20. Mat.</hi> 13. 20. compared with <hi>Ezek</hi> 33. 31, 32. but all this is but an imperfect taſte, and ſo they do nothing from right principles, neither by a right rule.</p>
                  <p>3. As we ought to act from a right principle, by a right rule, ſo in the laſt place to a right end; low baſe ends ſpoyl the higheſt undertakings: now he that doth a good action to a good end, doth mind theſe two things in his action.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He doth it to the glory of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170103:59"/>
to that Command of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He doth it for his own and others good, <hi>Rom. 2. 7. Mat.</hi> 5. 16. Now bring theſe things home, and lay them upon your hearts: make a curious, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, impartial, diligent ſearch, and ſee whether thou doſt act from ſuch a principle, by ſuch a rule, to ſuch an end.</p>
                  <p>If not, thou doſt the thing that is commanded, but not as it is commanded; thou doſt with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah, 2 Chron.</hi> 25. 7, 8, 9. That which is right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart, or elſe thou doſt a good action to an ill end, as in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p>And yet ſay to others and think in thy ſelf that thou haſt done well, as <hi>Jehu</hi> to <hi>Jonadab</hi> the ſon of <hi>Racab.</hi> Hence it appears that the ſtrength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of a deluded man or woman may be ſo great, that it may ſeem unto himſelf an unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing once to queſtion whether his heart be right, or the action good, even in thoſe actions wherein he came ſhort both of the matter, ground, form, and end.</p>

                  <p>Behold all ye whoſe faces are <hi>Sion</hi>-ward, here is a new and living way paved with promiſes. A way of ſtrength to the upright, wherein they may walk from ſtrength to ſtrength, till they appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in <hi>Sion.</hi> Let no diſcouraging thoughts concerning the difficulty of the work which is ſet before you poſſeſs your hearts, ſo as to hinder your application to it, and cheerfull progreſs in it. A yoak we are commanded to take upon us, but ſuch as is made moſt eaſie to bear, becauſe, that God which layeth it upon us, hath promiſed to ſtrengthen, ſupply and ſupport us; he who is righteous in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, is gracious in promiſing: let us be ſtrong in believing, and fervent in praying, and our work will be our meat, our duty our delight, and God will let us ſee that he hath either the Caſtle of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or the Ark of a promiſe, or the al-ſufficiency of his own grace, for a retirement of his people in the greateſt ſtorms and tempeſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſaid to the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30, 31.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170103:62"/>
                     <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Now might not the Jaylor have replyed as many do now in our daies, and ſay, I can as well make a world, work miracles, overturn moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as believe by mine own power; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> why bid ye me believe?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, though it be true, that every commard of God is alike difficult to fleſh and blood, that a man can indeed as well make a world, as make a prayer aright, a man may as well ſubdue an army of men, as ſubdue one luſt, did not the Lord convey a power into the ſoul, together with the command, <hi>viz.</hi> If God command a man to believe, and gives him power to believe, the work will ſoon be done, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. The Lord commands to make a new heart: now a man is no more able to make a new heart, then to make a new world: therefore as we ſaid before, he promiſeth in the ſame place to give a new heart: and in another place it is ſaid, mortifie your luſts: now this a man cannot do of himſelf: but the ſame God that commands us to kill our luſts, will kill them for us, <hi>Micah 7. 18, 19. He will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depth of the Sea.</hi> Again, God commands us to repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but we are no more able to repent, or to ſhed one tear for ſin then a rock is to give out water, or we are no more able to repent, then to turn the ſtream, or to make a ſlint fleſh, till the Lord give us a repenting heart: he hath promiſed to give repentance to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So that the commands in Scripture, doth not ſhew what the creature can do, but what he ſhould do, yet not by our own natural power,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170103:62"/>
but by his aſſiſting grace to enable us to do, what of our ſelves we cannot do, therefore we ſhould pray with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Lord give what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt, and then command what thou pleaſeſt.</p>
                  <p>To draw towards a concluſion to this point, let me acquaint the Reader of what I have obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all ſorts of men with whom I have more or leſs converſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt the Papiſt, both in their writings and diſcourſes, cry up and preſs all people to be doing good works. The <hi>Arminian</hi> his coſen Jerman, pleads for the ſame, and that almoſt, if not altogether, from the ſame principle, to the ſame end: the new upſtart Quakers, fals in and cloſeth with theſe old errors, preſſing people to do the thing that is commanded, but not as it is commanded; ſo many of our brethren of the Presbyterian party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and under a ſpirit of bondage themſelves, preach the Law before the Goſpel, and put their hearers to act for life, but not from life. So alſo our brethren of the Independant party, and thoſe of the Baptiſt party, many of them to my own knowledge do more mind the things they do for God in way of obedience to his commands, then they do the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from which, the rule by which, and the end to which they do it; and when they have done it, even theſe alſo are apt to lay too great a ſtreſs upon it. So then the Papiſt, freewiller, Quaker, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Independant, Baptiſt, all theſe preach, teach and cry out to all their hearers for a holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay to come a little nearer home, the word of God cals upon us for it, our own conſciences call for it, and check us for our remiſsneſs therein; nay the Chriſtians with whom we converſe expect it from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170103:63"/>
us, what remains then but that we be found in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of it, but let us beware we reſt not upon it, for as we are not to conclude our juſtification from any effects of ſanctification, ſo we are not to conclude that apprehenſion of juſtification to be from God, which takes us off the means, waies and rules of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: the Ranters error ſprings up in them for want of this diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>In a word, to ſay no more; duty is the matter of promiſe, as well as Gods mercy, as doth moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 12. Epheſ. 2. 8. Phil. 1. 29. Acts 5. 31. Joh.</hi> 8. 32. And our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſation is not the cauſe of our ſalvation, but the effect; neither do I hold that there is any free will in man, neither do I believe that any man hath, or ever ſince the fall, had any will or power of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without God to do any thing that is good, for in him, as the Scripture ſaith, we live, move, and have our being; ſo that in, through, and by God and Chriſt we may do all things, for he is a Sun, and a ſhield, and will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that wait on him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11.</p>
                  <p>Yet God hath given all men enough, to leave them without excuſe; what man is there that knoweth not, that if he make uſe of all the opportunities, will, power and underſtanding that God hath given him, but he may avoid more evil, and do more good then he hath done, or doth now do?</p>

               <head>Of Juſtification and Sanctification, how they differ, and wherein they agree.</head>
               <p>GOD in Juſtification imputeth the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt to us; in Sanctification his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit infuſeth grace in us. In Juſtification we read ſin pardoned, in Sanctification we read ſin ſubdued; the one doth free all Believers from the warth of God that they never fall into a ſtate of condemnation; the other neither equal in all, nor in this life perfect in any, but going on and growing up to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Again, Juſtification and Sanctification differ thus; to wit, Juſtification is the imputing of anothers ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to us, to wit Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sanctification is the impreſſion of Juſtice, that it may be in us.</p>
               <p>In Juſtification, there is ſatisfaction of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In Sanctification, there is the obedience of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Juſtification is a perfect and abſolute undivided act at once; Sanctification is a work begun, not equal in all, but carried on in all by degrees.</p>
               <p>Juſtification is firſt; Sanctification afterwards: conſiſting in ſeparation from ſin, filthineſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pollution.</p>
               <p>Juſtification and Sanctification are two inſeparable companions, where one doth dwell, the other will lodge; and as Election is the proper work of the Father, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4. Redemption of the Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 1, 2. So Sanctification is the proper work
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170103:64"/>
of the Holy-Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
               <p>Now there are four things conſiderable to ſhew us wherein we are to keep our Juſtification and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication diſtinct the one from the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to keep Juſtification and Sanctification diſtinct, in reſpect of the ſubject and matter of this, which is not any thing in us, or done by us: but the perſonal and ſpotleſs righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt made over to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is our duty to keep up our Iuſtification di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, although it be not accompanied with Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, although there be failings in us; the Prodigal in <hi>Luke</hi> 15. came and confeſſed his ſin as a ſon, and ſaid, Father I am not worthy to be called thy ſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſhould keep our Iuſtification diſtinct, and not go to reaſon out our Iuſtification from our Sanctification, but we ſhould look to Jeſus Chriſt, the Rock upon which a Chriſtian ſhould build his ſoul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſhould alwaies keep up, and keep diſtinct our Juſtification, as the ſpring and way to Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for the fruit of Juſtification, is peace, joy, boldneſs and ſtrength to do the will of God; all this doth come in from Jeſus Chriſt in a way of believing, and not from Sanctification; for as we are not to conclude our Juſtification from any effects of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, ſo we are not to conclude that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Juſtification to be from God, which takes us off the means, waies and rules of Sanctification: therefore although they be diſtinct in theſe four fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned heads, yet they agree, and go hand in hand in theſe enſuing things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:170103:64"/>1. They go together in theſe; he that is juſtified, doth as earneſtly deſire Sanctification and holineſs, as he doth heaven and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth as well deſire, that is juſtified by Chriſts righteouſneſs, to chuſe Chriſt as a King to rule over him, as a Saviour to ſave him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They go together in this reſpect alſo; a ſoul is not content with the apprehenſion of his Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs he finds ſome meaſure of, and growing up in Sanctification.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They go together, as doth appear by this; the man that is truly juſtified, he doth make as much care and conſcience to practiſe holineſs, as ever he did to get Chriſts righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They go together in this reſpect alſo: every diſcovery of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs to the ſoul for Juſtification, doth fit and heighten the ſouls reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for Sanctification and holineſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A man may be ſaid to keep his Juſtification and Sanctification together, when he doth truſt his ſoul in the hands of Chriſt for ſalvation, and makes it his work to die to the world, and to honour Chriſt in the world.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When a ſoul hath found out Chriſt, for his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, he doth make it his great buſineſs to be conformable to him in his converſation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. being made conformable to his death.</p>
               <p>Now if any ask,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Why a ſoul ſhould keep his Juſtification and Sanctification diſtinct in ſome things.</item>
                  <item>2. Why in other things we ſhould keep them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</item>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170103:65"/>
and Sanctification diſtinct, and yet to keep them together.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Then I anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. Why a ſoul ſhould keep them diſtinct: to which I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Spirit of God is diſtinct in laying down theſe things in the Scrptures, <hi>viz.</hi> in exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to come without money, and without price; and if we walk in darkneſs, and ſee no light, yet to truſt and ſtay our ſelves upon him, becauſe he doth love us freely, and pardon us graciouſly, and is found of them that ſought him not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe otherwiſe our ſouls can never be truly eſtabliſhed, rooted and built up in him, <hi>Iſaiah 7. 9. Eph. 3. 17. Col.</hi> 2. 7. he that doth mix Juſtification and Sanctification together, can never be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſhould keep them diſtinct, that ſo we might give God the whole glory of our Juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Is, why we ſhould in other things keep them together?</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That we might glorifie God before the world; its true, a ſoul doth moſt glorifie God by believing, but he doth more glorifie God before the world by his holy converſation, <hi>Matth. 5. 16. John</hi> 15. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe holineſs and ſanctification is the way in which the Lords people ſhall be ſaved. I do not ſay that this is the way by which, but the way in which ſalvation is manifeſted, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next reaſon why we ſhould keep them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is, becauſe thereby we ſhall ſtop the mouths of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170103:65"/>
wicked men, 1 <hi>Peter 2. 15. For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to ſilence the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of fooliſh men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We are to keep them together, becauſe this is the will of God, that all that do profeſs his name, and lay hold on his Mercy, ſhould live holily, 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 3, 4. For this is the will of God, even your ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that every one of you ſhould know how to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his veſſel in ſanctification and holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We are to keep up Sanctification as well as Juſtification, becauſe thereby the Lord will ſtop the mouths of wicked men at the laſt day, ſaying, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, you have done thus and thus for me and mine, Matth.</hi> 25. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Is, how ſhould a ſoul come to keep his Juſtification and Sanctification diſtinct, and yet keep them together?</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Meditate much on the free love of God, when we were in our blood, he was in his love; freely to love us, and graciouſly to juſtifie us: and then in the ſecond place the ſoul will ſay within it ſelf, ſhall I ſin againſt him that hath freely juſtified me?

               <p n="2">2. Dwell much upon thoſe engagements that God hath put upon us in the many great things that he hath done for us, <hi>Titus 3. 3, 4, 5. For we our ſelves were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another; but after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done,</hi> &amp;c.

that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Think much upon the littleneſs of our work or ſervices we can do to him, and the unſpeakable things that he hath done and promiſed to do for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what a diſproportion there is between his mercy to us, and our obedience to him; the one is like the Ocean Sea, the other as a grain of muſtard-ſeed; the one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, the other finite; the one as a great mountain that fills the whole earth, the other as a Pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Dwell much upon the great difference there will be between thoſe that make it their work to keep up their Faith and obedience, and thoſe that do not; at the coming of Chriſt, the one he will bleſs, and make them ſit down to meat, and will ſerve them, ſee that bleſſed place, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 37.</p>
               <p>The other hath neither Juſtification nor Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Lord will cut them aſunder, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them their portion with unbelievers, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 46.</p>
               <p>O what remains then, but that we labour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between our Juſtification, and our perſonal Sanctification. The firſt is quite out of our ſelves, conſiſting in the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs inherent in him, who ſits at the right hand of God, far above the reach and ſphear of ſins activity, and is therefore perfect and compleat, yea the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all bleſſedneſs; the latter is in our ſelves, and therefore weak and uncertain; he that underſtands not the true nature and doctrine of Juſtification, cannot enjoy true, ſtable and conſtant peace; but remains unſtable, apt to be led away with every
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170103:66"/>
wind of Doctrine; in the right underſtanding of this point, is treaſured up a fountain of ſoul-reviving conſolation.</p>
               <p>Surely, by what hath been ſaid, it doth moſt plainly appear, that a Chriſtians happineſs depends not upon his own doings, but on Chriſt, who is of God, made unto us Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, &amp;c. who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace. See 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. 2 Tim. 1. 9. Heb.</hi> 13. 8. Sanctification admits of degrees, Juſtification neither of Rules nor degrees; when we cannot apprehend God in a way of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, yet we are then comprehended of God, though our actual righteouſneſs be but as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous rags, and often fail us, yet then, even then, we have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt preſented to us, <hi>Iſa. 45. 24. Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength: their righteouſneſs is of me ſaith the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 54. 17.</p>
               <p>And this Righteouſneſs, as it is ours by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo it is perfect and endureth for ever, and is the foundation of all bleſſedneſs, therefore let us reſt ſatisfied with Chriſts righteouſneſs, and add nothing to it, let our hearts ſay with <hi>David, Pſalm 71. 15, 16, 19, 24. I will make mention of thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even of thine only, and wait upon him in Faith, prayer and patience, who hath promiſed that he will be as a dew to Iſrael, and that he ſhall grow as a Lilly, and caſt forth his fruit as</hi> Lebanon, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. 6, 7.</p>

                  <head>Of the ground of Faith.</head>
                  <p>THE ground of believing is the word of God, the Scriptures of truth; he that doth ſay he doth believe in God, having no Scripture ground, he doth deceive himſelf; the ground of Faith is without our ſelves, not a light in us, or any thing done by us: the ground of Faith is, God in his word doth offer us Chriſt, and Chriſt cals us unto him, and ſaith, he will in no wiſe caſt us off, but if we believe in him we ſhall have eternal life; now this is a word of truth, and this word of his is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation, and whatſoever was written aforetime, was written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, <hi>John 20. 31. But theſe things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that we might believe, and that believing we might have life through his name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scriptures of truth are the ground of Faith; as they do give a man ſufficient ground and warrant to believe whatſoever is contained in them; this was the ground of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> faith, remember the word upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 49.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scriptures are the ground of Faith, as it is a ſure word: as we are not to believe any thing that is not contained in Scripture, ſo we need not doubt of any thing that is promiſed in them: they are the faithful ſayings of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Scriptures are the ground of Faith, as it is a touchſtone to try all doctrines by, <hi>Iſa. 8. 20. John</hi> 5. 39.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:170103:69"/>4. They may be ſaid to be the ground of Faith, as they hold forth all things neceſſary to ſalvation, and all things neceſſary to be believed.</p>

                  <p>Again, in the Scriptures there are many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn invitations to poor ſenſible ſinners, to come and take milk and wine, and the water of life freely.</p>
                  <p>And many precious promiſes to thoſe that do come, with many examples left upon record, how well thoſe have ſped that did come; all theſe are grounds and encouragements to believe.</p>

                  <head>The Springs of Faith, how God doth beget it in an unbeliever.</head>
                  <p>THere is no natural power in man to produce a cauſe within its ſelf; this great grace of Faith is no fruit of the wiſdom of the fleſh, nor is it the birth of a corrupt will. The immediate and ſole cauſe of Faith is the Spirit of God: He it is who is greater then the heart, who can perſwade and draw the heart, and change and renew the Spirit: There be means appointed by God which he doth ordnarily bleſs, for the production of faith; as he hath ordained means for the revelation of Chriſt, ſo he hath ſanctified means to lead the ſoul unto him, to implant Faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God lets the ſoul ſee that it is the command of God, that he ſhould believe, and that faith is the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170103:69"/>
gift of God, without which we can do nothing accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; it is through grace that men believe, yet men are to uſe the means; now the great and ordinary means by which God works faith in the hearts of men, it is the preaching of the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See <hi>Act. 13. 48. When the Gentiles heard this they were glad, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the word of the Lord, and as many as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to life believed, Rom.</hi> 10. 17. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 13. In whom ye alſo truſted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The preaching of the word doth diſcover to the ſoul, its extream miſery, and great need of Chriſt, and makes him ſay, men and brethren, what ſhall I do to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is that which caſteth down all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, arguments, and diſputes of the mind againſt the conditions of Chriſt, and renders all the terms of Chriſt upon which he will be taken, as moſt equal, fair and reſonable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is that which clears the way for the ſoul againſt all its fears, and unbelieving doubts; it layes before the ſinner, the freeneſs of Gods mercy, the fulneſs of Chriſts Redemption, the willingneſs on Chriſts part to accept of him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is that ſets the ſoul in a patient expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to lie at the Pool, for ever to attend the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Saints, and to enquire in his Temple, till the ſoul can take a cloſe with Chriſt, by true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>

and will not yeild, then take another, if that will not do, then take another; and lay that home upon the heart, and never leave this work till you have gotten ſome ſmal meaſure of Faith.</p>

                  <p>AS the Eunuch ſaid to <hi>Philip,</hi> here is water, what hinders me that I may not be baptized? ſo may I ſay to my ſelf and others here in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: is Chriſt ſet out to the life? here are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fair enough to draw on our ſouls to Chriſt, what hinders that we do not believe and receive Chriſt?</p>

Alas they think not of theſe things: Now how is it poſſible for the ſoul to believe, or to be perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, or to labour for this precious faith, which is a ſtranger to it ſelf, to God, to Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>2. A ſecond impediment of Faith is a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of natural righteouſneſs; this was it which kept off many of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> the text ſaith, that they truſted to their own righteouſneſs, they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own rigteouſneſs, have not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the righteouſneſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3, 6.</p>
                  <p>3. A third impediment of faith is the honour of the world; how can you believe, ſaith Chriſt, which receive honour one from another, <hi>John</hi> 5. 44. again, <hi>Mat. 19. 22.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond motive is or may be thus; conſider that Chriſt plainly ſaith, that he that will not believe ſhall be damned, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18, 36.</p>
                  <p>Excellency prevails much with an ingenious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and neceſſity with the worſt nature: When the Leapers ſaw that they muſt either venture their lives or dye, they would out into the Camp: when the Prodigal ſaw he muſt famiſh abroad, or repair home, he would then back to his fathers houſe; when the woman with the iſſue of blood had ſpent all, and grew worſe, and knew not whither to go, or what to do, then ſhe comes to Chriſt: now if thou haſt not ſo much ingenuity as to come to, and believe in Chriſt, in obedience to his command, yet let thy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity prevail with thee, or elſe the Leaper and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt thee: were we in <hi>Adams</hi> created innocency, then we need not to look after a Saviour, but we are fallen, but we are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but we are ſold under ſin, but we are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours from the womb, but we are by nature the children of diſobedience and wrath.</p>

                  <p>VNbelief doth rob the ſoul of all joy, comfort and content: Nay further, unbelief doth throw reproach upon God, Chriſt and the promiſes, and gives Satan the greateſt advantage againſt us; he that lives without Faith, lives without comfort, joy, peace and content; by unbelief we add ſin unto ſin in the higheſt nature, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>Unbelief ſtraightens the heart, ſtops the mouth, and hinders thankfulneſs; <hi>thou ſhalt be dumb, becauſe thou believeſt not, Luke</hi> 1. 20.</p>
                  <p>Unbelief is the door that lets in condemnation. <hi>John 3. 18, 30. He that believeth not is condemned. Rev. 2. 8. The fearful and unbelieving ſhall be caſt into the Lake of fire and brimſtone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. It is the greateſt ſin in the world, becauſe it is a ſin againſt the greateſt love in the world, <hi>John</hi>

3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. It is a ſin for which there can be no remedy, for aſmuch as it is a ſin againſt the only remedy; the Sentence of the Law may be repealed by the Goſpel, but the ſins againſt Goſpel remedy there is no appeal, it is a ſin that makes void and vain all the Covenant of grace, turning all the ſweetneſs thereof into bitterneſs, and all the truth of it to a lie, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>Unbelief binds all our ſins upon the ſoul, and ſo murders the ſoul, it grieves the heart of Chriſt, leaves all our ſins upon record, leaves us to anſwer for our ſelves: it is a ſin againſt the greateſt love, againſt the only remedy, makes void the Doctrine of grace, and breeds an indiſpoſition towards all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties: it is a diſhonouring to God, a denying of Chriſt, a murderer of the ſoul, a belying of God, a denying of Chriſt, and a crowning of Satan; it doth without doubt proclaim the Devil a Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and lift him up above Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Judas</hi> did ſin more by unbelief, and deſpairing, then by betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt. In a word, doubts, fears and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, proceed neither from God, Chriſt, nor the Spirit of truth, but they do proceed, Firſt, from the Devil, he either tempts us to ſin, and that will cauſe us to doubt, or elſe he doth tempt us to doubt, and that will cauſe us to ſin. Secondly, they proceed from our own hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. Thirdly, from the lying vanities that we hearken unto, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 8. Fourthly, from ignorance, heedleſneſs and forgetfulneſs.

                  </head>
                  <p>THere are many characters or diſcoveries of this Faith of the Goſpel, called the Faith of Gods Elect, which worketh by love. Firſt, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of this Faith is infuſed into the ſoul, by God in regeneration, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. Secondly, this habit ſo infuſed, is brought to act by the Fathers drawing the ſoul to Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 44. Thirdly, faith being thus infuſed and acted, doth chearfully accept of Chriſt upon his own terms, <hi>viz.</hi> ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, bearing the Croſs and following Chriſt, <hi>Luke 9. 23. Iohn</hi> 1. 12. Faith having thus accepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt, begins to taſte ſuch ſweetneſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs in him, that Chriſt is moſt pleaſant to the ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 3, 7. So the ſoul by degrees comes to be filled with joy and peace in believing. Again, Faith having thus taken and taſted Chriſt, contends after a fuller perfection, even after aſſurance, <hi>Col. 2. 2. Heb.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True Faith is not only a juſtifying grace, but a ſanctifying grace, <hi>Acts 15. 9. &amp;</hi> 26. 8. the blood of Chriſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a pure blood as well as a precious blood. It is a cleanſing blood, as well as an expiating blood.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170103:73"/>
So faith is a grace not only to acquit, but alſo to purge and renew the perſon where it dwells. It is not only an enlightening grace, but it is alſo a conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace; therefore we read that it doth ingraft us into the ſimilitude of his death, and in the fellowſhip of his ſufferings and Reſurrection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>Now then enquire; is there vertue gone from Chriſt to make thy dark mind ſeeing, thy ſtubborn judgement yielding, thy proud heart humbling, thy filthy heart cleanſing, thy hard heart relenting and mourning, thy carnal affections to be heavenly, thy ſinful ſoul to be holy? Read and well conſider that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where there is true Faith, it will cauſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make a curious, narrow, impartial, diligent ſearch into his own heart and ſoul, to ſee what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, what ſelf-denyal, what ſin abhorrency, what love to Chriſt, what delight to the Ordinances, what zeal for Gods glory, what contempt of the world, what deſires after the ſociety of the Saints, what ſympathizing with them in their afflictions? and if upon this ſearch thou findeſt any impreſſions of grace, any ſpiritual work, any ſavouring, ſavory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing operations upon thy heart, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath been there, and begun to work the grace of Faith in thy heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. True Faith doth make the heart humble and lowly; Have we pardon of ſin? why ſaith Faith, the cauſe of this is Gods love: Have we righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? why ſaith Faith, the cauſe of this is Chriſts merits: Have we any gift? why ſaith Faith, the cauſe of this is Chriſts love. So that the ſoul ſits down, and often ſaith, O Lord, O Lord, in my ſelf
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170103:74"/>
I am nothing, nay of my ſelf worſe then nothing. But what I am, I am by grace, all that I have is thine, my bread, my health, my life, my body, my ſoul, all is thine. If any love, if any mercy, if any Chriſt, if any grace, if any comfort, if any ſtrength, if any ſtedfaſtneſs, if any performances, if any good work, if any good word, if any good affection, if any good thought, why, all is thine. I have nothing but what I have received, thou only art the cauſe, I am leſs then the leaſt of thy mercies, and what is thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that thou ſhouldſt look on ſuch an one as I am? thou madeſt me, and thou boughteſt me, and thou calledſt me, and thou juſtifieſt me, and thou ſaveſt me.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. True Faith doth deſire and endeavour after an increaſe; Help my unbelief, ſaid the weak believing Father. <hi>O Lord encreaſe our Faith,</hi> ſaid the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; there are yet many degrees wanting to faith; either thou canſt not be perſwaded, or not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, or not conſtantly perſwaded; but if the Faith be true and living, it will bend after a riſing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. True Faith in Chriſt, and a mournful heart for ſin alwaies go together, <hi>Zach.</hi> 10 12. They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and mourn, &amp;c. there are two things that Faith will fetch up in the ſoul, the one is love to Chriſt, another is ſorrow for ſin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. True Faith is fruitful, <hi>James</hi> 2. 18. See <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 18. Although works do not cauſe Faith, or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yet they do clearly manifeſt to others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have Faith yea or no.</p>
                  <p>To cloſe up this point, let me acquaint the Reader,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170103:74"/>
that there are ſpiritual and inward characters of Faith, which ſerve as evidences to him that hath it, many of thoſe I have hinted at under this fore-going head. Secondly there are outward or more external ſigns of Faith, and they conſiſt in walking, ſo in the ſight of men, that they may in charity judge of our Faith by our works: then there are characters of a ſtrong Faith, and alſo ſigns of a weak Faith: Firſt of a ſtrong Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. he ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbelief. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8. I have not found ſo great Faith in <hi>Iſrael. Mat. 5. 22. O woman, great is thy faith,</hi> &amp;c. So there are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a weak Faith; One is, he will be haſty to be anſwered, and be ready to ſuſpect Gods favour, and Chriſts love, if he be not preſently anſwered. Another is, he will be faint if delayed. And ſo much for the characte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Lord hath various diſpenſations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as well relating to the outward, as to the inward man. Sometimes his way is in the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and ſometimes he is in the ſmall ſtill voice, and ſometimes his foot-ſteps are in the deep waters, and ſo his way is not known. <hi>Nah. 1. 3. &amp; 1 Kings 19. 12. &amp; Pſalm</hi> 77. 19.

As bleſſed <hi>Job, David,</hi> and divers others experienced. Now the reaſon why we ſhould believe, hope and rejoyce in God at all times, are as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe a Believers happineſs depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own doing, but upon Chriſt, who is of God made unto him righteouſneſs, ſanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who hath ſaved us, and called us, not according to our works, but according to his purpoſe and grace, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Cor. 1. 3. 2 Tim</hi> 1. 9</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the ſtate of a Believer in Chriſt, as conſidered in him, is a ſtate of perfection, he is clean from all ſin by the blood of Chriſt, they be removed from us; thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back; as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved our tranſgreſſions from us: ſeventy weeks are determined upon the people, to finiſh the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and to make an end of ſins, and to make reconciliation, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>John</hi> 17. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 35. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 38. 17. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103. 12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 14.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the ſoul begins to rejoyce in God, for he hath cloathed me with the garment of ſalvation, and covered me with the robe of righteouſneſs.

                  <p n="3">3. Reaſon: Why a Believers comfort, hope, joy and confidence ſhould be the ſame at all times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God who hath loved an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

love, loves thee in his Son: thou art not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved for thy own ſake, or for any thing in thee, but upon the account of the Lord Jeſus, in whom God is well pleaſed: Believers are never the more juſt before God for their own integrity, nor the leſs juſt for their iniquity.

                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p>In Chriſt thou haſt perfectly obeyed the Law, perfectly ſuffered and ſatisfied for all thy ſins to the juſtice of God; ſo that in Chriſt, thou art perfectly juſt and righteous, and thereupon it is ſaid, <hi>Col. 3. 3.

to ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus; though in thy ſelf there is a body of luſt, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſin, and there is a law revealing ſin, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and condemning, but if we live by faith in Chriſt, and in the apprehenſion of his love, believing in the life, righteouſneſs, obedience, ſatisfaction, and glory of him whom the Spirit cals ours. Chriſt is ours, we are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods: he then lives out of the power of all condemnation, Chriſt being the end of the Law for righteouſneſs; and thus a believer is bleſſed only in a righteouſneſs without, not within, and all his aſſurance, confidence and comforts to flow into him through a channel of faith, and not of works, believing himſelf happy for what another, even Chriſt hath done for him, not for what he hath done, nor can do for himſelf: for when we are at the beſt, we are but vanity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 5. and unprofitable ſervants, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. By it we give the greateſt honour to God, <hi>John 3. 33. He hath ſet to his ſeal that God is true,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170103:77"/>
but he that believeth not hath made him a lyar, 1 John</hi> 5. 10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p>Faith in Chriſt ſupplies all wants, it honours God, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. the whole Chapter: and God honours thoſe moſt that live by it: by it, ſaith the Scripture, the Elders obtained a good report; by faith we may live a life to God, of joy in him our righteouſneſs, as if we had never ſinned; by faith we live above ſin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, temptations, deſertions, ſenſe, reaſon, fears and doubts: Faith ſweetens the ſweeteſt mercy, and the bittereſt miſeries, it renders great afflictions as none, it is the bulwark of the ſouls ſtrength and comfort: by Faith we cheerfully, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and univerſally, and conſtantly obey God. In a meaſure it makes the the yoak of Chriſt eaſie and ſweet, it ſtates the ſoul in the poſſeſſion of heaven, whilſt the body remains on earth, as <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. By faith we view the glory of heaven, and know our ſelves to be happy, even then when to a carnal eye we ſeem moſt miſerable. By faith we can cheerfully part with, and ſuffer deprivation of the ſweeteſt outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and enjoyments, and welcome them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we do but exchange the worſt things, and place for a better; thoſe that live up by faith, live upon God, and are refreſhed in his houſe, which is

He that lives by Faith in infirmities, may be thus characterized.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He will hear Chriſt and not the voice of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>John</hi> 10. 27. 5.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Ground or reaſon, why believing on the Son of God is ſo hard, is becauſe every thing in man doth fight againſt it: hence it doth come to paſs, that believing doth require the greateſt piece of ſelf-denyal in them: for a man to break the Law, and yet to be freed from the curſe of the Law, this reaſon cannot comprehend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ground why ſo few believe, is, either becauſe they think they do believe already, and yet do not; or elſe they would believe, but ſay they cannot: Firſt they think they do believe, and yet do not, and theſe are of three ſorts; Firſt, ignorant perſons: now ignorance and unbelief, they alwayes go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; we read of <hi>Paul</hi> that did things before he was converted, in ignorance and unbelief. <hi>Jer. 4. 22. My people are fooliſh, they know not me, to do good they have no knowledge.</hi> Secondly, thoſe that boaſt and glory in their own righteouſneſs, theſe have no faith in Jeſus Chriſt and his righteouſneſs. The third ſort of people that do think they do believe and do not, are prophane perſons, and theſe be of two ſorts, men of prophane ſpirits, and men of prophane lives, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane practices.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ground or reaſon why ſo few believe, is, becauſe it is the great deſign of Satan either to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or overthrow our Faith; becauſe believing doth give the greateſt glory to God, and brings in the greateſt good to us. Firſt, it doth give the greateſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170103:79"/>
glory to God of any work in the world, it doth give glory to his truth and faithfulneſs, and power, and mindfulneſs. So it doth give glory to Jeſus Chriſt, to his name, power and God-head, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and attributes; by doubting we diſhonour him, fruſtrate the grace of God, make the death of Chriſt of none effect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Reaſon why believing is ſo hard a work, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the multitude of falſe Doctrines that there are in the world, that a man ſcarce knows who to hear, or whom to believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>Of Repentance unto life.</head>
               <p>REpentance and faith are two inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; where the one doth dwell the other will lodge, in the Covenant of grace there is place for repentance, and mercy for the penitent. Let us firſt enquire what true repentance is, <hi>viz.</hi> Some ſay repentance is a grieving for ſin, both original and actual, ariſing from an apprehenſion of diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo loving a God, 2. <hi>Cor. 7. 11. For behold this ſelf-ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort: what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your ſelves? yea what indignation? yea what fear? yea what vehement deſire? yea what zeal? yea what revenge in all things?</hi> &amp;c. Repentance is not only a turning from evil to good, but a hating the evil we turn from, and a loving the good we turn to.</p>
               <p>True repentance is a general univerſal change of the whole man in every part; though it be but in part, it doth change both heart and life, word and work, it makes darkneſs light, and bitter ſweet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:170103:80"/>
and a Leaper an Angel, <hi>Iſa. 1. 16, 17, 18. Waſh ye, make ye clean:</hi> there is the change of the heart: <hi>put away the evil of your doings,</hi> there is the change of the life. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30, 31, 32. Or repentance is a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal change in the whole man, the underſtanding is turned from darkneſs to light: the will from ſinfulſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude to an holy liberty: the affections from diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into order, the heart from hardneſs into ſoftneſs: ſo the eye of wantoneſs into an eye of chaſtity: the uncircumciſed ear into an obedient ear: the hands of bribery into the hands of liberty: and the feet of vanity into the waies of purity. Repentance for ſin is nothing, without repentance from ſin.</p>
               <p>He that hath repented indeed, doth ſtill deſire to have his ſin purged, as well as pardoned: repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a work that muſt be timely done, or we be utterly undone: he that hath truly repented, doth now ſtrike moſt at thoſe ſins that he was moſt prone to before: the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. Waſhed thoſe wounds that his own hands had made but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: he acts in waies of mercy, quite contrary to his former cruelty: So did <hi>Zacheus, Luke</hi> 19. So did <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. So did <hi>Manaſſes, 2 Chron.</hi> 33. 6.</p>
               <p>True repentance hath theſe choice companions at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. The firſt is Faith, <hi>Mar. 1. 14. Repent ye therefore and believe the Goſpel.</hi> Secondly, love to Chriſt doth alwaies accompany repentance, as we may ſee in <hi>Mary Magdalen, Luke</hi> 7. Thirdly, fear of offending God, and an holy care to honour him, theſe and the like companions do alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company true repentance, they were born together, and they will live together, till the ſoul doth change earth for heaven. Conviction goes alwaies with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170103:80"/>
and repentance and forgiveneſs of ſins goes alwaies together, ſo doth ſanctification and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: this repentance is a flower that grows not in natures garden, <hi>Jer. 13. 23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpot? &amp;c.</hi> Men are not born with repentance in their hearts, as they are with tongues in their mouths.</p>

               <p>FIrſt of the Nature of ſin.</p>
               <p>Although ſin hath but one nature, yet it hath ſeveral names; in every ſin we take from God, and add to another thing. Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, and not believing and obeying the Goſpel: ſin defiles a man totally, it begins at the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo to the will and affections: ſin robs a man of the Image of God, of the preſence of God. Sin was the firſt founder of hell, and laid the firſt ſtone thereof. And yet, moſt of this is but the effects of ſin: the eſſence muſt needs be much more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hence ſin is called poyſon, and ſinners Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. Sin is called vanity, and ſinners dogs. Sin is called mire, and ſinners ſwine: the leaſt ſin virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more or leſs, contains in it the nature of all ſin; no ſooner did one ſin ſet upon <hi>Adams</hi> heart, but he had all ſin in him; every ſin doth put God upon complaining, Chriſt upon bleeding, and the Spirit upon grieving, and the ſoul a mourning: many ſin by omiſſion and commiſſion, at one and the ſame time, and yet know of neither: the more there is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170103:81"/>
of the will in the acting of ſin, the greater the ſin is. Some ſins of omiſſion may exceed ſome of commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the more deliberation, and the weaker tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions any hath, and yet ſinneth, the greater the ſin is.</p>
               <p>Many a man is full of ſinful corruption, but ſhew it not for want of occaſion. No ſooner did one ſin ſeize upon <hi>Adams</hi> heart, but he had all ſin in him.</p>

                  <head>How ſin creeps up, and gets head in us.</head>
                  <p>SAtan firſt tempts us to be ſtrange one to another, and then to divide, and then to be bitter and jealous, and then to bite and devour one another: again, haſty and froward words begets anger; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger being kindled, begets wrath; wrath ſeeketh gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily after revenge. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 14. Sin is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching nature, it creeps on the ſoul by degrees, ſtep by ſtep: <hi>David</hi> gave way to his wandring eye, and ſo fell into the ſins of murder and adultery: again, Satan will firſt draw a ſoul to be unclean in his thoughts, then in his looks, then in his words, and then in deeds; he will firſt draw a ſoul to look on the golden wedge, and then to love the golden wedge, and then to handle the golden wedge, and then to gain the golden wedge. Again, he will draw a ſoul, firſt to have low thoughts of Scripture and Ordinances, and then to ſleight Scripture and Ordinances, and then with the Ranters and Quakers to caſt off Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Ordinances: Again, if we give way to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motion it will be great, vain thoughts, and vain thoughts will beget idle words, and idle words will beget petty oaths. Sins of omiſſion do alſo open
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170103:81"/>
the door, and make way for ſins of commiſſion: and again, fearfulneſs and timerouſneſs doth ariſe from weakneſs and feebleneſs, and weakneſs and feebleneſs doth ariſe from unbelief or incredulity; the beginning of ſin is oft by the Devils ſuggeſting evil thoughts: evil thoughts cauſe delight, delight conſent, conſent engendereth action, action cauſeth cuſtom; ſo one ſin draweth on another: grant a little and a great deal will follow. Sin is ill in the eye, worſe in the tongue, worſer in the heart, but worſt of all in the life: there are three waies how Satan comes into the Soul to cheat it. Firſt as a ſubtile Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in evil thoughts. Secondly, as an Angel of light, in lying Prophets and evil ſpirits. Thirdly, as a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyon, in Perſecutors.</p>

                  <p>God had one ſon without corruption, but no ſon without correction; he had one ſon without ſin, but no ſon without ſorrow: Sin will coſt a Chriſtian more grief, ſorrow, heart-bleeding, and ſoul-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before conſcience will be ſatisfied, and comfort reſtored, and evidences cleared, and pard on in the Court of conſcience ſealed: For God is as ſevere in puniſhing, as he is gracious in pardoning, his houſe of correction is his School of inſtruction; Sin doth make God look ſeverely, and chide bitterly, and ſtrike heavily, even where and when he loves dearly. <hi>Iſaiah 59. 2.

The Firſt ſaid, to meditate of Death; the Second ſaid, to meditate of Judgement; the Third ſaid, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the Joyes of Heaven: the Fourth ſaid, to meditate on the Torments of Hell: the Fifth ſaid, to meditate on the blood and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt: and certainly the laſt is the ſtrongeſt motive of all to mortifie ſin; that ſoul that doth this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 4, 5. ſhall no more be called forſaken, for the Lord will rejoyce over him, and be a well-ſpring of life unto him, and make his abode with him, and turn his ſighing into ſinging, and his trembling into rejoycing, and his priſon into a Paradiſe; then the ſoul will break forth, and ſay in theſe or the like words, O bleſſed be God for Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſed be his name for that precious blood that hath juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our perſons, and quieted our conſciences, and ſcattered our fears, and anſwered our doubts, and given us the triumph over ſin, hell and death; who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died: this made <hi>Paul, Rom. 8. 33. to the</hi> 38. cry out, <hi>victory, victory;</hi> he lookt upon all the enemies, and

ſings it ſweetly out, ſaying, <hi>Over all theſe we are more then Conquerors:</hi> in a word, from Chriſt alone we have ſtrength to perform any duty, to exerciſe any grace, to ſubdue any luſt, to reſiſt any temptation, to bear any affliction. <hi>John 15. 5.

Chriſt is made unto a Believer righteouſneſs and ſtrength: now if we want Faith in Chriſt, we want righteouſneſs by way of acceptation, and we want ſtrength by way of aſſiſtance: Surely the mercy of God is the moſt powerful argument to perſwade a ſoul from ſin. <hi>Pſalm 26. 3, 4. For thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth.</hi> So <hi>Joſeph, Gen. 39. 9. How can I do this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> his ſoul being taken with mercy, was not moved with his miſtreſſes impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 3.

If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, ye ſhall live. Heb. 9. 14. How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, through the eternal Spirit, purge our conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi> Surely, ſurely, if the bowels of mercy do not melt, win and draw us, Juſtice will be a ſwift witneſs againſt us: all divine power and ſtrength againſt ſin, flows from the ſouls union and communion with Chriſt; it is only Faith in Chriſt that binds the ſtrong man hand and foot; it is only Faith in Chriſt that makes a man triumph over ſin, Satan, hell and the world: And that ſtops the iſſue
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170103:84"/>
of blood, that makes a man ſtrong in reſiſting, and happy in conquering, ſo that ſin alwayes dies moſt, where faith lives moſt; ſo that we muſt get up Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel principles, if we would keep up Goſpel practices:</p>

                     <hi>Quere.</hi> We read in the Bible of many over head and ears in ſin, and yet at laſt became great Saints. I pray how came thoſe to mortifie their ſin?</p>

For we our ſelves ſometimes were fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, and ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another</hi> (there is the myſterie) but after that the kindneſs and love of God appeared not by works, of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, (there is the remedy,) in a word, the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the love and grace of God the Father, and the love of God the Son, the promiſes of God, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt: the example of the Saints, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward held forth to us in the Goſpel makes a ſound Chriſtian to hold on, and to hold out, reſolving to conquer, or to dye conquering.</p>
                  <p>As a Chriſtian grows up in the aſſurance of Gods love, ſo he will better heal his ſtrong luſts: an heart ſoftned and reconciled to God, willingly cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the commandment, ſo that the beſt way to mortifie ſin, and to amend our lives, is to lay hold on the love of God by faith in Chriſt, and ſo firſt to get aſſurance of forgiveneſs, which ſoftens the heart, and enlightens the eyes to ſee that it is only the blood of Chriſt that purgeth from dead works.

Thirdly, the rule or Pattern of this act, he purifieth himſelf as God is pure: this is not a word of equality, but of reſemblance. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ground or motive inciting to this purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> hope of glory: every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf as he is pure, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2, 3. Hope in Chriſt excites to purity, becauſe it conducts us ſtraight to Chriſt the perfect pattern of all purity. Surely it is the appearance of Gods grace to us, which works a hope of glory in us, and this hope of glory doth purifie theſe ſeveral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing waies.</p>

both in kind and degree, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs both of fleſh and Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Now hypocrites waſh the outſide of the platter or cup, but inwardly they are full of extortion and exceſs, Mat.</hi> 23. 25, 26.</p>

                  <head>Whether the Dominion of ſin may not be taken away, where yet the life of ſin remains.</head>
                  <p>SIN may live where it doth not reign, and dwell where it is not welcom; it is true, the Scripture doth ſay, they that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts; but here the Scripture doth not ſpeak of a total ſubduing of ſin, as if every luſt and corruption ſhould be quite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but only this far, to give a deadly blow to ſin, that ſin ſhall not reign nor bear ſway in thy ſoul as it hath done formerly; the dominion of ſin is taken away, but the life and being of it is continued for a little time. As <hi>Hagar</hi> would dwell with <hi>Sarah</hi> till ſhe beat her out of doors: ſo will ſin dwell with grace, till death beat it out of doors: there ſhall be ſome remainders of ſin ſtill in the beſt of Gods ſervants, but ſin ſhall not reign in their mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſin may live in a Saint, and yet the Saint not live in ſin.</p>
                  <p>Let us now examine in what caſes, and with what limitations ſtrength of corruption may conſiſt with ſtrength of grace? the reſolving of this queſtion is of very much uſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though ſin be ſtrong, yet grace may be ſtrong
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170103:90"/>
too in thy ſoul; though thy ſin be great, if thy ſorrow be great too, it evidenceth thy grace is ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you find a ſtrong oppoſition againſt your corruptions, though you cannot fully ſubdue ſin, yet do you ſtrongly oppoſe it: then there is ſtrength of grace in the ſoul, though there be ſtrong corruptions in the body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is ſtrength of grace, where there is ſtrong cries to God againſt thy ſins, this argues grace, and the ſtrength of grace, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is ſtrength of grace in that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is reſolved in the ſtrength of Chriſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his ſtrong ſins, or die conquering of them; our Lord Chriſt when two things were ſet before him, either to ſin or die, he choſe death, rather then ſin, and by degrees he works his Spouſe to the ſame mind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That ſtrength of grace may be conſiſtent with ſtrength of corruptions, I might inſtance in many precious Saints, I will mention one for all the reſt, and that is in <hi>Peter;</hi> who had not only truth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, but eminency and ſtrength of grace: For though temptations and corruptions did ſometimes prevail, yet he had ſtrong affections towards Chriſt, he did out-ſtrip many of the Diſciples.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was the man that of all the Diſciples wept moſt bitterly for his ſins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 75.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt that ran to the Sepulchre to ſee what was become of Jeſus, <hi>John</hi> 20. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He was the man who hearing that Chriſt was riſen, leapt into the Sea for joy, <hi>John</hi> 21. 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He was the firſt man that made the firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170103:90"/>
and firſt preached the Goſpel after the Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He had that love to Chriſt as ſtrong as death, for he ſuffered death afterwards for Chriſt; but now although in the caſes before mentioned, ſtrength of grace may be conſiſtent with ſtrength of corruption, yet there are other caſes wherein they are altogether inconſiſtent; though there may be ſtrong grace, and ſtrong corruption in the ſoul, yet the reign of any one corruption in the ſoul, yet the reign of any one corruption is utterly inconſiſtent with grace, and the ſtrength of it. See <hi>Rom. 6. 12. &amp;</hi> 7. 23.</p>
                  <p>And when I ſay there is a conſiſtency between grace and corruption, I would be underſtood of ſpiritual and inward corruption, <hi>viz.</hi> of hardneſs of heart, Spiritual pride, deadneſs in duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For into groſs external open acts of ſin, ſtrong Chriſtians do ſeldom fall.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Spiritual, experimental knowledge is a free gift of God, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6.

                  <p n="6">6. True knowledge doth indear Chriſt and the things of Chriſt to the ſoul, <hi>Cant. 2. 5. I am ſick of love,</hi> I cannot live in my ſelf: I can live only in Chriſt who is my life, <hi>Galatians 6. 14. God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing but Chriſt.</hi>

Now put all theſe together, and they ſpeak out with open mouth, that a man may attain to a great meaſure of knowledge, and yet be in the account of God, in the account of Chriſt, in the account of Chriſtians, an ignorant man, he is without ſpiritual and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge, without an affective, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive knowledge, and without an appropriating, and practical knowledge. I ſhall cloſe up this head with a few cautions and conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take this for a truth, that in a Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to complain of ignorance, is a good degree of knowledge, <hi>Prov. 30. 2. And I have not the knowledge of a man, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:170103:95"/>2. Take this alſo for a truth, that in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he knows moſt that doth moſt, <hi>Pſal. 111. 10. A good underſtanding have all they that do his commandments:</hi> God doth not meaſure our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by our queſtions and diſputes, but by our practices, as in <hi>Jer. 22. 16. He judgeth the cauſe of the poor and needy; was not this to know me, ſaith the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take this alſo, that it is not the wanting of ſome meaſures or degrees of knowledge, that doth make a man ignorant in the ſight of God, but the want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of true knowledge of the Father, Son, Spirit, and Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> I am ſurely ignorant of God, ſaith many weak Chriſtians: I do not know him, he will come in flaming fire, taking vengeance on me.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Suppoſe thou art ignorant of God, yet if thou art not conſentingly ignorant, if thou art not a ſelf-conceited man or woman, that thinkeſt thou knoweſt much, when thou knoweſt little, thou art well enough, if thou art not like thoſe, in <hi>Hoſ. 8. 2. Iſrael ſhall ſay unto me, my God we know thee,</hi> and yet there is no fear nor knowledge of God in the Land.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thou doſt not ſit down contentedly in thy ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, but doſt labour and endeavour after more knowledge, then thy condition is good enough; but if thou ſayeſt unto God in thy heart, as in <hi>Job 21. 14. Depart from me, for I deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes;</hi> then thy condition is extream bad.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If thou art not obſtinately ignorant, like thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Pſalm 82. 5. They know not, neither will they underſtand, but they walk on in darkneſs:</hi> When
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170103:96"/>
men be ignorant, and will be ignorant, this is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they have no ſaving work of God upon them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. ſaith the Apoſtle, theſe things they are willingly ignorant of.</p>
                  <p>Now if thy ignorance be accompanied with theſe three circumſtances, that you are conceitedly, and contentedly and obſtinately ignorant, the Lord be merciful to thee, thou art in a ſtate of death and damnation; but on the other hand, although thou haſt abundance of ignorance in thee, yet if thou doſt bewail it, and labour and deſire after more knowledge, if you follow on to know the Lord, and are not obſtinately ignorant, thy condition is good.</p>

               <p>OF the nature of this love.</p>
               <p>Although Chriſtians do ſomewhat differ in their defining it, what it is, yet in the eſſence or body of it they agree; but before I can orderly come to ſpeak of the ſeveral definitions that Chriſtians give of it, I muſt acquaint the Reader of the ſeveral ſorts of love, <hi>viz.</hi> there is a love natural, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a love ſinful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there is a love ſpiritual.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is love of pitty, as in a Father to a ſick and vitious ſon, or one friend to another in miſery: or if you pleaſe there is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. A natural love planted in the heart of man to love himſelf, his children, wealth and acquaintance: Now the ſpiritual love that we ſhall ſpeak of by and by, doth ſet banks to the ſtream of natural love, that it run not over, either to over-love, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieve.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a love of complacency: So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is well pleaſed with an obedient ſon, the husband with a vertuous wife, the School-maſter with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Scholar.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a love of friendſhip, when a man doth both honour and reſpect ſuch and ſuch good people, and is ſo beloved of them again.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:170103:98"/>5. There is a love of dependance, when we love one upon whom all dependeth, namely God; whom alſo we love, with a love of complacency and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, being a full object, free from all mixture of evil, and altogether ſupernatural; this ſupernatural love is that I intend to ſpeak to, and firſt of the nature of this love; in which I ſhall take notice of the various judgements of many precious Chriſtians, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of it, although in the main they all agree.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One ſaith, it is an holy diſpoſition of the heart ariſing from faith, whereby we cleave to the Lord, with a purpoſe of heart to ſerve him, and to pleaſe him in all things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another ſaith love is a grace wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God, in perſwading the party of Gods love to it; and ſo the ſoul comes to love God, becauſe he did firſt love him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others ſay, it is a ſupernatural grace flowing from Faith, inſtilled by God himſelf, whereby through the mercy of God we ſee the great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of him, and thereby are drawn to love and yield obedience to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Others ſay it is an holy affection, or act of the will, or diſpoſition of the heart, whereby it cleaves or makes forward to ſome good, that is agreeable to it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Others ſay, it is a ſpark of heavenly fire, that puts all the affections into an holy flame. <hi>Cant. 1. 7. Tell me O thou whom my ſoul loveth. Iſa. 26. 9. With my ſoul have I deſired thee, yea with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> He that planted the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love in our hearts, may well call for his own,

               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Several ſorts or kinds of Love.</head>
                  <p>BEſides what hath been ſpoken in the foregoing head, there are ſeveral ſorts and kinds of love; as, Firſt there is a fleſhly and carnal love, which is altogether ſinful. Secondly, there is a naturall ove, as in a Parent to a child, and one relation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thirdly, there is a civil love, ſuch as one neighbour and friend hath to another. Fourthly, there is a religious love, and that is twofold, the one is ſubordinate to the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt there is our love to God. Secondly to his people, as they bear his image. Firſt to God himſelf, who is the very eſſence of love, he is nothing elſe but love, God is love, neither ſhould there be any thing beloved by us, but as it either conveys love to us from him, or elſe deaws up our affections to him; there is alſo a love to our enemies required of us, which we ought to be found in the practiſe of, in obedience to the command of God, and in love and pitty to their poor ſouls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44.</p>
                  <p>But that love that I ſhall treat of is, that love ſpoken to in Scripture, which is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5.</p>

                  <head>Of the ſprings of Love, how it is begotten and encreaſed in us.</head>
                  <p>THE Lord tells us by <hi>Paul, Rom. 5. 5. That the Love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> he ſhews us that he loveth us that were of no worth, and whileſt we were in our ſins, that he dyed for us, and then he doth ſhed the ſenſe and feeling thereof abroad in our hearts, whereby we come to taſte and ſee how good and gracious the Lord is, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34. 8.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Spring of love is this, the Lord doth unveil himſelf a little to the ſoul, whereby it ſees his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, <hi>viz.</hi> wiſdom, power, riches, beauty, glory, faithfulneſs and amiableneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Spring of love is this, the ſoul having ſeen ſomething of his excellency, and ſo loves him, not only becauſe of that, although he be moſt worthy of love, but alſo becauſe he hath caſt his love upon us: and ſo in the ſecond place, the ſoul comes to love Chriſt, becauſe he firſt loved us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 10, 19. as fire begets fire, ſo doth love beget love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Spring of love is this, after the ſoul hath ſeen the worth of Chriſt, and the love of Chriſt, it comes in the next place to ſee that the love of all relations doth meet in the love of Chriſt: and this doth raiſe up a Chriſtian to love Chriſt with a ſupream love: Love is as a Load-ſtone, drawing the affections to love Chriſt, as to one that is aimable and lovely, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and glorious, ſpotleſs and matchleſs, in his name, in his nature, in his offices, in his graces, in his
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170103:100"/>
gifts, in his diſcoveries, in his appearances; in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, he is full of gravity, majeſty, and mercy, and glory, he is the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. So the ſoul loves Chriſt for that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable goodneſs and natural ſweetneſs that there is in him. But others that ſee it not, reject thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious invitations, reject the Kings Supper, and think it ſtrange that thou runneſt not with him to the ſame exceſs of riot.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Spring of love is this, the Lord preſents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoul, Firſt his love in giving Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the love of Chriſt in giving himſelf, and this many times takes with a ſoul, and makes it break forth in theſe or the like expreſſions; O the love of God to ſinners, to give his ſon, and not a ſervant, his own ſon and not another, his only ſon and not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, his only begotten ſon, and not an adopted ſon, that he ſhould ſend and give him, when he was not ſought by us, but freely given by him to us, not friends but enemies! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the next place conſider, the love of Chriſt in giving himſelf; O how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful was his love to us, it was not a love to the fallen Angels, but to fallen man! Oh what hath he undergone for us! O that he that was equal with God ſhould come in the form of a ſervant! That he that the heaven of heavens could not contain, ſhould be cradled in a Manger, and from his cradle to his Croſs, his whole life was a life of ſorrows! Oh that the Judge of all fleſh ſhould be condemned, the Lord of Life put to death, that he that was crowned with honour and glory, ſhould be crowned with thorns! That that face that was white and ruddy, ſhould be ſpit upon by the beaſtly Jews! and that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170103:100"/>
tongue that ſpake as never man ſpake, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of blaſphemy! That thoſe hands that ſwayed the Scepter, and feet that were as fine braſs, ſhould be nailed to the Croſs! He was tempted by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, reviled by the High Prieſts, branded for a Babler, Wine-bibber, and Sabbath-breaker, and Blaſphemer! all this he ſuffered for us out of love to us, ſhall we not love him? his true love to us will be ſatisfied with nothing but love again—This is another Spring of love.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The firſt character of this grace of love is this; true love will be ſatisfied with nothing but love again; what doth all avail, as long as we may not ſee the Kings face.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe whom we love we often think upon, our thoughts faſten on them. <hi>Pſalm 139. 17, 18. How precious are the thoughts of thee unto me O God, how great is the ſum of them? when I awake I am ſtill with thee.</hi> So that ſleeping or waking, his mind runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: try thy love of God by this; if thou think not often of God, thou loveſt him not; but if thou canſt not ſatisfie thy ſelf with profits, pleaſures, friends and other worldly objects, but thou muſt turn other buſineſſes aſide, that thou mayeſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170103:101"/>
daily think of God: then thou loveſt him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe whom we love, we will not willingly offend; no bars are ſo ſtrong as love; Sooner will the ſervant offend his maſter, the ſon his father, the wife her husband, the ſubject his Protector, then him whom he ſpiritually loves. Friendſhip binds faſter then any authority; <hi>Jonathan</hi> will offend his natural Father, rather then his ſpiritual brother, <hi>David: Joſeph</hi> will offend his miſtreſs, rather then his God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe whom we love, we acquaint with our grievances, and lay open our miſeries to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms; their counſel we ask, and from them we look for help. 2 <hi>Chron. 20. 12.

O Lord my God, in thee do I put my truſt, ſave me from all them that perſecute me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe we love, we take any ſmall token kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from them; a pin from a friend is more eſteemed then a pound from an enemy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. compared with <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 15.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thoſe whom we love, we can bear any thing that comes from them; we can endure their reproofs and their corrections; the child can be contented to be ſtruck by the Father, that would not not take a blow of another. <hi>Pſalm 39. 9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth becauſe thou didſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. That love that we bear to the people of God, is a ſure token of our love to God, the image of God is graven in them, and they that love God, love thoſe images of him that himſelf hath ſtamped; and the more like they are to God, the more they love them: But not to love them, is delivered as a note of the children of the Devil. 1 <hi>John 3. 10.

                  <head>Of the Properties of this true Love.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. WHere there is love to God, and faith in Chriſt, it makes the ſoul long for, and earneſtly deſire the appearing of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. There is a Crown of righteouſneſs laid up for all them that love his appearing:</hi> as when we love any, we love their preſence. It is true, ſometimes good men are afraid to die, but it is becauſe they would be better fitted for their Bridegrooms coming: beſides the beſt have fleſh as well as Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another property of love is this: Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to ſpeak well of the party beloved. <hi>David</hi> abounded in love to God, and therefore could never ſatisfie himſelf in ſpeaking of, and praiſing him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Love is bountiful and ſeeks not its own, as doth abundantly appear in this bleſſed portion of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another property of love is this, it will put the whole man to work for the party beloved: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Will, Affections, Tongue and Hand, and all will fall to work, when others ſtand frozen and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed: ſurely the heart that loves Chriſt is ſtill drawing nearer and nearer to him, aſpiring towards heaven, and thriving in the work of grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And laſtly, love commandeth the affections, of anger and fear, it moderates the one, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the other.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay more of the properties of this love? he that hath this love of God ſhed abroad in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170103:103"/>
his heart, doth look upon Chriſt as the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, and ſo ſpeaks good of his name, <hi>Pſal. 34. 8. O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, a ſoul comes to love him for himſelf, becauſe he is the object of love. And ſo this man grieves when he is either diſhonoured or ſlighted.</p>

                  <head>Of the motives or inducements to perſwade us to get into, and grow up in this Love.</head>
                  <p>THE motives to perſwade us to make out after this love, may be drawn from, either the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that we ſhall get by it; or from the hurt or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in neglecting it. To begin then with the laſt firſt, 2 <hi>Cor. 16. 22. If any man love not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let him be curſed with a double curſe,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Iohn 4. 8. He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love:</hi> and if we know him not. 2 <hi>Theſ. 1. 8. he will come in flaming fire taking vonge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on them that know him not. Iohn</hi> 5. 42. Theſe people have not the love of God in them. <hi>Ioh. 8. 42. Ieſus ſaid to them, if God were your father, ye would love me,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 10. In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil; whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brorher: in a word, there is nothing that we ſay or do that will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Lord without this love, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 1, 2, 3. Though I ſpeak with the tongue of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and though I have the gift of prophecy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all myſteries, and though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, and have not this love, I am nothing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider the excellency of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170103:103"/>
it, and the benefits we ſhall get thereby. Firſt, it is moſt like to God, 1 <hi>John 4. 16. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God.</hi> Again, it is called by <hi>David,</hi> a joyful, bleſſed and pleaſant thing: Again, it is recorded in Scripture as one of our evidences for heaven, 1 <hi>John 3. 14. By this we know we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren:</hi> and our love to our brethren is a ſign of our love to God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 20. Laſtly, love will ſtand when all other graces will fail, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. Love never faileth, ver. 13. now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, theſe three, but the greateſt of theſe is Charity.</p>

                  <head>Of our love to the children of God, the nature of it, the tryals of it, the means of attaining it, and impediments that hinder it.</head>
                  <p>1. OF the nature of it: Chriſt is nothing elſe but love, and there ſhould not any thing be beloved by us, but as it either conveys love from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe draws up our affections unto him; and our loving of his body the Church, will effect both theſe. The nature then of this love, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under theſe enſuing heads. When we love them, as ſuch in whom we ſee the Image of Chriſt, for their ſpiritual brother-hood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. The godly for godlineſs ſake, for God in them: Chriſtians for Chriſtianity, for Chriſt in them; the Saints for their Saint-ſhip, for their Sanctity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and converſation; The ſpiritual children begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for their Heavenly Fathers ſake: when grace is

the principal load-ſtone of our affection; when for this we love them, more then for beauty, ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, birth, breeding, learning, wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, gifts, wealth, honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo love all ſuch as we apprehend to be the children of God; for he that truly loves one child of God, as a child of God, loves every child of God, whether noble or ignoble, rich or poor, bond or free, male or female; for the ſame God, the ſame Chriſt, the ſame grace, is as truly amiable in one, as in another. See <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>Hence we alſo come to love them moſt, that are moſt gracious, for where grace allures the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more grace there is in any perſon, there is the ſtronger motive and allurement to love more. Jeſus loved all his Diſciples, <hi>John 13. 1. But John he loved eminently above all the reſt, John</hi> 21. 20. And ſo as grace grows in the ſame perſon, true love towards him will grow proportionably.</p>

So, though I cannot certainly, and infallibly tell whether ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loves me, yet I can certainly tell whether I love him or no; his love to me is in his heart, which I know not; my love to him is in my heart, which I know, and no creature elſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If I would indeed know if I love the brethren, let me examine how I do ſtand affected to them, in ſympathizing with them when they be in miſery, <hi>Heb. 13. 3.

                  <p n="4">4. What delight do we take in their company; we are often in the company of thoſe that we take no delight in: Now do we indeed delight in the ſociety of the Saints: then we love them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Next of the external tryals of this love, by which we may know, that others do love us, and by which they may know that we love them.</p>
                  <p>But theſe evidences are not ſo infallible as the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170103:105"/>
other, we read <hi>John 13. 35. By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:</hi> and how doth our love unto another appear, but in theſe or the like things, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He that doth love his brother, will be apt to reprove him when he doth ill, and praiſe him when he doth well; a friend can bear a ſharp reproof from a friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another evidence of love is this, we acquaint thoſe whom we love with our miſeries, lay open our griefs, and account it ſome eaſe to diſcharge ſome of our ſorrows into their boſoms; their advice we ask, and from them we look for aſſiſtance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where love is in the heart, it will appear in the tongue, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Love is kind, but there is a great deal of verbal and complementary love with men, forbidden in the Scriptures of truth, ſaying, love not in word and tongue, but in deed and in truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another Character of love is this, when thou haſt ſome injuries offered thee, thou wilt not ſoon be angry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. love ſuffereth long.</p>

               <p>Or, hope is that vertue, whereby we expect all good things from God, and ſo patiently attend in the uſe of his appointed means, for all things that we need, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 4, 5. and 37. 7. and that not only when we have the means, but alſo when we want all apparent means, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

                  <head>Of the Properties of this hope.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. FIrſt, this hope as an inward principle, works out pollution, and corruption, as being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant thereunto, 1 <hi>John 3. 3. And every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, as he is pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hope is alwaies more or leſs exerciſed about heavenly things, <hi>viz.</hi> Sometimes it is exerciſed about the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſometimes it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about the love of God the Father in giving Chriſt: ſometimes hope is exerciſed about the word and promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 49, 81, 114. and <hi>Pſa. 130. 5. In thy word do I hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hope in the promiſes will keep the head from aking, and the heart from ſinking: in a word, the promiſes are the ladder by which hope gets up to heaven, and ſo hope in the promiſes will ſupport a diſtreſſed ſoul, and reduce a wandring ſoul: hope in the promiſes will confirm ſtaggering ſouls, and ſome undone ſouls: The promiſes are the Anchor of hope, as hope is the Anchor of the ſoul, See <hi>Rom. 8. 24. Gal. 5. 5. Tit.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hope hath much in reverſion, though little in poſſeſſion; hope can ſee a glimpſe of heaven through the thickeſt cloud; hope can ſee light through darkneſs, life through death, ſmiles through frowns, and glory through miſery; hope holds life and ſoul the together; it holds the ſoul and the promiſes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it holds the ſoul and heaven together.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hope never takes off, but puts the ſoul upon

                  <p n="5">5. Hope will enter into that within the vail, <hi>Heb. 6. 19. Which hope we have as an anchor of the ſoul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt,</hi> which entreth into that within the vail.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another property of hope is this, it will help a ſoul to wait patiently upon God, for any thing it doth ſtand in need of, <hi>Rom. 8. 25. For if we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it.</hi>

                  <p>But a preſumptuous hope, that hopes for heaven, as its end, but never acts holineſs, as its way to heaven: in a word, falſe hope doth hope much and act little. Wicked men will hope for ſalvation, but not work out their ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>THE Church of God is in Scripture reſembled to a natural body, wherein are many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers united to each other, and to one head, by one Spirit: now in order to this union, we are to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves together in obedience to that great command. <hi>Heb. 10. 25.

And ſo goes out by the foot-ſteps of the flock, and propounds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Church, and puts himſelf upon the tryal of the truth of that work of grace in his heart: So that a Church is at firſt gathered by the word preached and faith received of them that hear it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. but to come to particulars, I ſhall according to my meaſure ſpeak or write of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of aſſembling under theſe two heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it relates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to thoſe that are converted, but never as yet joyned to any Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it relates to thoſe that are converted, and joyned to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>1. As it relates to thoſe that are converted, but never as yet joyned to any Church of Chriſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: let them conſider, that it is their duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound themſelves to, and endeavour to joyn with the Church. For firſt the Lord in his Word doth command it. And ſecondly the example of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Saints, whoſe foot-ſteps we are to follow, doth call for it; and therefore you no ſooner read
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170103:115"/>
of a people converted, but the next news, they were baptized and added to the Churches: and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why: becauſe God commands us not to forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves together. And ſecondly, although our being depends not upon our joyning with a Church of Saints, yet our well-being doth much depend upon it: If any ask how or by what means is a Church at firſt gathered? I would ſay to them again. What is written? how readeſt thou? you are to obſerve no other Rule, means or way, then what is either expreſt, implyed, or included in the holy Scriptures of truth, where we may find out the right Ordinan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1. LET ſeven, eight, nine or ten, or more of thoſe men that are moſt ſound in the Faith, and moſt unblamable in their lives and converſation, appoint one day to faſt and pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and earneſtly ſeek unto God for his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herein, and toward the end of the day, let them one by one give an account of the work of grace upon their hearts, and of the hope that is in them, and then give your ſelves up to the Lord, and one to another by the will of God, with no other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant then this, to endeavour as God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, and enable you to walk together in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, Ordinances, and inſtitutions of Chriſt, the head of the Church, expreſt, implyed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

                     <p>2. In the end of this meeting appoint your next meeting, both time and place, expecting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt with you to aſſiſt and teach you, according to his promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. See the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies Annotations on this verſe.</p>
                     <p>3. You having proceeded thus far, you may look upon your ſelves as a Church of Chriſt in its infancy, and when other Chriſtians by the word preached, and Faith received, deſire to joyn with you in this or the next meeting, let their names be propounded, which being done, let the brethren appoint a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to confer with them about the time when, the place where, the manner how the Lord did firſt appear to them in a powerful conviction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and regeneration, or ſomething equivolent thereunto: and if they give ſuch an account of the work of grace upon their hearts, as doth ſatisfie the brethren, that the Lord hath begun a work in this creature, that he hath promiſed to finiſh, as in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. Then you are to proceed to a ſecond queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being as before ſatisfied in the firſt; that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a hewed and ſquared ſtone, and a living ſtone, fit for the ſpiritual building: in the next place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the ſaid party that deſires to joyn with you; what is his or her grounds and ends in deſiring fellowſhip with you, and if you find that their grounds be in obedience to the command of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. and their ends be, that they might enjoy God in all his ordinances, and have a fellowſhip with thoſe that have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170103:116"/>
is, being united by Faith to Chriſt and his members, he may pertake of his grace, and ſpiritual life from him, and by him be united to God the Father, and have communion with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
                     <p>All that are admitted, muſt put themſelves upon the reſt, and be received by conſent, for the Church is Chriſts kingdom; now the matter or ſubjects of Chriſts kingdom, they are believers gathered out of the world, by the preaching of the Goſpel, and the powerful Miniſtry of the Spirit, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 44. hence it is that the Church in Scripture are frequently called Saints, and holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, the houſe of God, and Temple of the holy Ghoſt, the houſhold of Faith, born from above, of the Spirit, that they might worſhip God in Spirit and in truth; they were darkneſs, but now are light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 8. They were loſt, but now found; were dead, but now are alive; they before had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy: were not a people, but now are a people of the living God; the Father diſdains not to count them his ſons and daughters; the Son is not aſhamed to call them brethren; the Holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to make them his temple to dwell in; all which diſcovers and confirms that the Church of Chriſt are and ought to be a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual building, made up of ſpiritual ſtones, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                     <p>Now if any profeſſor hang back, and ſeek not to joyn with the Church of Chriſt, only becauſe he will not be examined before the Church, in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars before mentioned, then let me ask that man
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170103:117"/>
or woman, child or ſervant, how it is that you are unwilling to venture your eſtate in this world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt adviſing with a Lawyer; and thou wilt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with Phyſitians about thy bodily health, but will adventure their ſouls upon their own judgement and tryal, without taking the advice of the Church of Chriſt: is thy ſoul leſs precious to thee then thy body or thy eſtate? if thou haſt truth of grace, why wilt thou not bring it to the touchſtone, and come to examination? if no grace, why wilt thou refuſe the way and means to get it? ſurely thou doſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this way either,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Our of ignorance and pride, becauſe thou wilt not have thy ignorance diſcovered.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or elſe it is from a prophane ſpirit of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt all the wayes of Chriſt, held forth in the Goſpel. See thy doom, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 14, 27.</p>
                     <p>4. The Church being thus planted, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof increaſed. If you find ſome qualified, you ought to proceed to elect your Officers, the Church being a moſt free Corporation under Chriſt the Lord, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 19. She is in all reaſon and equity to chuſe her Officers and Miniſters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27, 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Unto whom alſo ſhe is to give aſſiſtance, obedience, and maintainance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7, 9. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4, 5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                     <p>Now that theſe Officers of the Church appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, are to have their outward calling from the Church, whereof they are members, for the preſent, and unto whom they are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, will fully appear by theſe few reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtles, who taught only
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170103:117"/>
Chriſts commandments, ſo directed the Churches, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the people amongſt whom they have been converſant, can beſt judge of their fitneſs both in reſpect of their gifts and graces.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe it furthereth much the diligence and faithfulneſs of the Miniſter, that they whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter he is, have freely choſen him, as unto whom under Chriſt, they commit the moſt precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Alſo, it binds the people to greater love, and obedience to him or them, whom themſelves have made choice of. But if any of the officers ſo elected by the Church be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in his place, he is by the Church to be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take heed to his Miniſtry he hath received, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 17. to fulfil it; which if he neglect to do, by the ſame power which ſet him up, he is to be put down and depoſed.</p>
                     <p>Now if any ask how many are the officers or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Church? I anſwer, there are five, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the extraordinary offices of Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Evangeliſts, for the firſt planting of the Churches, which are ceaſed with their extraordinary gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, there is, or ought to be the Paſtor, to whom is given the gift of wiſdom, for exhortation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The teacher, to whom is given the gift of knowledge, for Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The governing Elder, who is to Rule with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Deacon, who is to receive and diſtribute

the holy treaſure, with ſimplicity and ſincerity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 1, 3.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The widdow or Deaconeſs, who is to attend the ſick, and impotent with compaſſion and chearfulneſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 3, 9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1.</p>
                     <p>All theſe are uſeful and neceſſary, and theſe alone ſufficient for the Church, as being the moſt perfect ſociety, and body of Chriſt, which neither faileth in that which is neceſſary, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in any thing ſuperfluous; ſo they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and compacted together by that one Spirit, to the Lord, and each to other to the edifying of its ſelf in love, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4. 3, 4. and 16. In the want or in the abſence of any of theſe ſervants of the Church; the Church hath power to appoint any one or more of her members for the preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſupply the room or abſence of her officer or officers.</p>
                     <p>2. But then in the next place for thoſe that are united to a Church of Chriſt, let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that they forſake not the aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10. 25. And again, conſider the danger of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10. 38. Now if any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him: Again, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 62. And Jeſus ſaid unto him, no man having put his hand to the plough, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, is fit for the kingdom of God. Surely thoſe that fall off from a true Church of Chriſt, and perſevere therein to the end, ſhall hear Chriſt ſay to them, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. <hi>But thoſe mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:170103:118"/>
How dreadful is this ſin of falling off! Firſt, it is ſharply threatned of God, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 14. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38, 39. Secondly, this ſin is ſeverely plagued, <hi>Matthew</hi> 12. 43, 44, 45. compared with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22.</p>
                     <p>Again, See 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 19. <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us:</hi> Theſe were once in the Church, but never truly of the Church; for then they would have perſevered; their apoſtacy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth evidence their hypocriſie; falſe rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten profeſſors, will, and in all ages hath thus apoſtatized.

It is moſt obſervable concerning God the Father, who is the great Maſter-piece of ſpeech; when he ſpake from heaven, he makes uſe of three ſeveral texts of Scripture in one breath, <hi>Mat. 17. 5.

                     <p>A Miniſter of the Goſpel is duly to divide and diſtribute the word according to every ones ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eſtate and condition; they muſt ſpeak comfort, to whom comfort belongs, and counſel to whom counſel belongs, and reproof to whom reproof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and terror to whom terror belongs, 2 <hi>Timothy 2. 15.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth often glory in this, that his preaching was not in wiſdom of words, or in excellency of ſpeech, not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, not as pleaſing men but God, who tryeth the heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. and the ſecond <hi>chap. 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 4.</p>

                     <head>What a Miniſter is to preach.</head>
                     <p>IT is undoubtedly the duty of all Miniſters to preach Jeſus Chriſt unto the people, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 5. We preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and our ſelves your ſervants for his ſake.</hi> We no ſooner read that <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, but the next news of him is, <hi>Acts 9. 20. And ſtraight way he reached Chriſt in the Synagogues:</hi> Chriſt is to be preached, becauſe the preaching up of Chriſt, is the only way to preach down Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, or whatſoever makes againſt Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>Again, Chriſt is to be preached, becauſe this is the only way to ſave and win ſouls to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12. compared with <hi>John 17. 3. Acts</hi> 2. 14 to 42.</p>
                     <p>If any ask further what a Miniſter is to preach? Then I anſwer, he is to preach the Goſpel, and he is to preach the Law, for ſo did Chriſt and his Apoſtles: but the Goſpel is to be preached chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and mainly, but the Law accidentally and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, as will more fully appear in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>THis is the Commiſſion and meſſage of Chriſt, <hi>Mark 16. 15.

                        </gap>l <hi>Galilee,</hi> teaching in their Synagogues, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe it was the practice of the Apoſtles, <hi>viz.</hi> we read of <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 2 2. That he determined to know or make known nothing amongſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified: Hence Miniſters are called the Miniſters of the New Teſtament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. And in another place they are called the Miniſters of Chriſt, and of righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did preach the Goſpel in the firſt place. So again, <hi>Paul</hi> when he came to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 3. He delivered unto them, firſt of all that which he alſo received: how that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, according to the Scriptures, which was plain and pure Goſpel. So again, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylus,</hi> upon the firſt queſtion propounded unto them by the keeper of the priſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 31. They exhort and teach him to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and good reaſon, becauſe believing was to

Tit.</hi> 3. 8. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God: and thoſe that had believed in Chriſt, ſhould be carefull to maintain good works. So again, <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. before he ſpake of the <hi>Jews</hi> crucifying of Chriſt, he did preach the free and bleſſed Goſpel to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But I have heard ſome of our brethren of the Presbyterian Congregations object againſt this truth, and ſay, how can men come to ſee the want and need of Chriſt, if the Law be not firſt preached?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſuppoſed that all men do look upon themſelves as ſinners, and acknowledge themſelves to be ſinners, although they have not ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and ſenſible conviction the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eof, and ſo the work of the Miniſter is not ſo much to ſhew men the need of Chriſt firſt, but rather the love of God in giving Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. and to ſhew and ſet forth the riches of Chriſts grace to ſinners in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>Romans</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But is it not the firſt work of the Spirit to convince men of ſin? <hi>John</hi> 16. 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By ſin in that place is meant the ſin of unbelief.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 3. If the Law be not to be preached firſt, when and to whom is the Law to be preached?</p>

part may have its due place and dependance, which will be a great advantage both to the preacher and hearers, <hi>viz.</hi> A man may more eaſily retain them, when they are linked together, and not ſcattered; Method being as a chain, in which if a man ſhould let ſlip any one part, he may eaſily recover it again, by that relation and dependance which it hath with the whole; the Method which many do think is moſt uſeful, is that of Doctrine and Uſe, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and Application; Allegorical interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may lawfully be uſed, obſerving theſe three qualifications.</p>

                     <p>3. The next thing to be conſidered, and that is the matter, in which there is two things to be conſidered.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Whether more cheerful and zealous, or more cold and ſluggiſh. That ſo you may rightly divide the word of truth, and give to every one his portion, and propheſie according to the analogy of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
                     <p>And keep to the form of ſound words, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. And that you do this according to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Peter</hi> tels you, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. That you muſt not make the Scripture ſpeak in a private ſenſe, that is, you muſt not analize, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them ſo, as if the propheſies thereof did relate only to the particular occaſion and circumſtances of times, of places, and of perſons in, by, and to whom they were at firſt ſpoken, ſo much to the Preface, Method and Matter: the laſt help unto preaching is the Expreſſion, in which there be two things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Phraſe.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>1. The Phraſe ſhould be plain, full, wholſom, and effectual, and natural to the text; the greateſt learning is to be ſeen in the greateſt plainneſs. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth often glory in this, that his preaching was not in wiſdom of words, and excellency of ſpeech, not with inticing words of mans wiſdom, not as pleaſing men but God, who tryeth the heart: what ſhall I ſay more?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He muſt ſpeak according to the mind of God in Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20.</p>

                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:170103:128"/>2. He muſt ſpeak to exhortation, edification and comfort, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He muſt ſpeak nothing but that which he hath been taught of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He muſt ſpeak as an Oracle of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
                     <p>2. In the Elocution there are two extremities to be avoided.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Too much boldneſs.</item>
                        <item>2. Too much fear.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. Too much boldneſs: as a remedy againſt this, conſider the ſpecial preſence of God and Angels; the ſolemn dignity of theſe ſacred Myſteries, the weighty buſineſs of ſaving ſouls, and who is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for theſe things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Againſt too much fear; conſider it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the buſineſs you are about, for you ſhould ſpeak the word with boldneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 29. God hath promiſed his aſſiſtance, that his ſtrength ſhall appear in your weakneſs: Again, conſider tim erouſneſs in the ſpeaker will much hinder the efficacy and power of the word on the hearers, ſo that the moſt proper manner of Elocution is with Modeſty and Gravity. I have dwelt longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point then I intended, I proceed to the next.</p>

                     <p>Again we read <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. that it is the duty of the people ſo to do, <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things,</hi> Luke 10. 7. <hi>for the labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 8. <hi>I robbed other Churches, taking wages of them to do you ſervice;</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 9. <hi>For it is written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox, that treadeth out the Corn:</hi> doth God take care for oxen, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But we read of the Apoſtles, or at leaſt ſome of them, that they did preach the Goſpel of Chriſt freely, as appears, 1 <hi>Theſ. 2. 9. &amp; 2. Cor.</hi> 11. 7.</p>

                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:170103:129"/>For there was a commiſsion from the Lord, as well to live of the Goſpel, as to preach the Goſpel: which no man can deny, unleſs he deny the Scripture to be his Rule, or elſe remain ignorant in that rule.</p>
                     <p>But withall take theſe cautions? a Goſpel mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by the Lord appointed, is for none but a Goſpel Miniſtry, plants of his own planting, the other plants are to be pluckt up: then alſo this maintenance muſt be collected in a Goſpel way, not by Tythes, and commencing ſuits at Law, and taking away their goods by violence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>1. Of the nature of it, what Prayer is.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is a ſpeaking to God face to face, wherein we ſpeak to him in Faith, Humility, Sincerity and Fervencie of Spirit; it is <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, by which a ſoul climbs up to Heaven, and it is <hi>Noahs</hi> dove that goeth forth and returns not till it brings an anſwer of peace. Or prayer is a calling upon God alone in the name of Chriſt by the help of the Holy Ghoſt, or it is the earneſt requeſt of an humble and ſanctified Heart, together with thankſgiving, in behalf of our ſelves and others, with aſſurance to be heard in what
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170103:131"/>
we pray for, according to the will of God, <hi>Phil. 4. 6. Rom. 8. 26. Pſal. 50. 15. Eph. 6. 18. 1 John 5. 14. James</hi> 1. 6. Or Prayer is a Familiar ſpeech with God in the name of Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 14. Opening the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of our hearts unto him, and a pouring out of the heart before him for the things we need, <hi>Pſal. 50. 15. Jer. 33. 3. Lam.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>Or prayer is a ſpiritual gift and grace of the holy Ghoſt, teaching us both what to pray for, and how to pray, enabling us to pour out our ſouls unto the Lord with ſighs that cannot be uttered, <hi>Pſal. 62. 8. Rom. 8. 26. Pſalm</hi> 145. 18. the Lord is nigh to all them that call upon him in truth: Heart and tongue muſt go together, word and work, lip and life, prayer and practice muſt eccho one to the other: it is not the greatneſs of the voice, nor the multitude of words, nor the ſweetneſs of the tone, nor the ſtudied notions, nor the Eloquent expreſſions, but truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, that is prevalent with God: now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of effectual prayer are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we pray underſtandingly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with Underſtanding,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we pray earneſtly and importunately, <hi>James</hi> 5. 16. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 8.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. We ſhould pray in humility, without ſwelling, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13.</p>

                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:170103:132"/>7. We ſhould pray in zeal without cooling, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We ſhould pray with reſolution to uſe all good means for the obtaining the things we pray for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Heart may pray without the tongue, with fruit and feeling, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 10. But the tongue without the heart is nothing but vain babling.</p>

                     <head>Whom we are to pray unto.</head>
                     <p>SUrely we are to pray to God alone, and to none other, for he alone as the great Searcher of all hearts, heareth the voice, and knoweth the meaning of the Spirit of Prayer, <hi>Pſalm 25. 2. Rom.</hi> 8. 27.</p>

                        <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> oppreſſed by his enemies, to whom goes he to complain? to none but unto God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. To whom went <hi>David</hi> to complain of the bitter words of <hi>Cuſh</hi> the Benjamite? to none but unto God, <hi>Pſalm 7. 1. O Lord my God in thee do I put my truſt, ſave me from all them that perſecute me, and deliver me,</hi> He alone is able to grant whatſoever we demand; <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20. Wherefore ſeeing he alone hears all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, heals all Sinners, knows all Suiters, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. 2 Chron. 7. 14. 1 Chron. 28. 9. Pſal.</hi> 44. 21. He alone hath love enough to pity all, and power enough to relieve all our wants and neceſſities; to him alone we are to pray, and to none other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. Thus we muſt pray only to God, in the only name, and for the only ſake of his Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the alone Mediator between God and man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>

                     <p>So that we are to pray for all ſorts and degrees of men, eſpecially publike perſons, as rulers and ſuch as are in Authority, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 2. and for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that watch over our ſouls, Epheſ. 6. 19. Col.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
                     <p>So alſo we are to pray for our ſelves, us and ours, for all things that we want, either for ſoul or body, that doth concern our being, or well being.</p>

                     <head>What extraordinary prayer is.</head>
                     <p>EXtraordinary prayer is that which is made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſpecial occaſion, or extraordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident falling out, felt or feared, upon a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, City, Family, or Perſon; by reaſon whereof our prayers are both longer, and ferventer then at other times, <hi>Pſalm 119. 62. Acts 12. 5. Joel 2. 15. Ionah</hi> 3. 6. See <hi>Ezra 9. Dan.</hi> 9. and <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. In theſe times of Faſting, or extraordinary praying, or both, we are moſt earneſtly and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently to call upon God either for the obtaining of ſome ſingular benefit, or ſpecial favour that we ſtand in great need of, or for the avoiding of ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial puniſhment, or notable judgement hanging over our heads, or already fallen upon us, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30, 31, 32. and 14. 23. 2. <hi>Chron 20. Ioel</hi> 1. 2, 12. 16.</p>
                     <p>There are three things to be conſidered about this extraordinary prayer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is ſomething to be conſidered before we enter upon it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is ſomething to be conſidered in this prayer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is ſomething to be conſidered after this prayer.</p>
                     <p>1. Something to be conſidered before this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary prayer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What our wants are, either for ſoul or body, our ſelves or others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What promiſes we have from God, that he will give us ſuch things.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That we agree together, to pray for theſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170103:133"/>
things, with one tongue and one heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let us alſo for the keeping up our Faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what wonderful things prayer hath done; it hath healed the ſick, and raiſed the dead, unlooſed chains, and unlocked priſons, and ſet the Saints free, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 5, 7, 11.</p>
                     <p>2. There are ſome things to be conſidered in prayer, and they are four.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That we call upon God in truth of heart, <hi>Pſal. 145. 18. Pſal.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beware of drilling out too much time in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; long prayers oftentimes deaden others affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: it is good to pray brief and often, as Chriſt did, <hi>Matthew</hi> 26. 39, 42, 44. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When we pray to one in the Trinity, let us mind all three, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and ſever them not.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let us be very importunate, and earneſt, and ſervent; and that we may do ſo, conſider the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the things we ask, and the neceſſity of them, <hi>Rom. 15. 30. Pſal.</hi> 143. 6. Conſider, how did <hi>Daniel</hi> pray in the Lions den, the three children in the fiery furnace, <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Whales belly, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the dungeon, and our Saviour Chriſt, when he prayed, and ſweat drops of blood? let us endeavour to pray ſo, that he may turn our darkneſs into light, our deadneſs into life, our bondage into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and our weakneſs into ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>3. And laſtly, there be four things to be conſidered after prayer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Preſs after what we have prayed for, in the uſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170103:134"/>
of all the means for the accompliſhing or obtaining of thoſe things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 2, 4, 5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hearken and liſten what the Lord doth ſay, as a man that doth knock at a great mans door, he liſtneth to hear if any body be coming, if not, he knocks again and again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Expect and wait patiently for a full anſwer, <hi>Pſal. 40. 1. I waited patiently for the Lord, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto me, and heard my cry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Learn wiſely to diſtinguiſh between delayes and denials, and not take a delay for a denial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 21. to 29. Chriſt did delay the woman pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, but not deny her, and at laſt did give her more then ſhe had asked. Surely, as prayer is the cry of our hearts, to open all our neceſſities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 19. So it is alſo the key of the Lords treaſury, and to obtain the mercies from him that we need; ſo we pray in the name of the Son, by the help of the Spirit according to his will, with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, reverence, humility and fervency, faith, love, and perſeverance.</p>

                     <p>SOme men are very apt to ſay, it is of no uſe to pray unto God, ſeeing he both knoweth what we need, either for his glory, or our good, and hath determined what to beſtow upon us: but let me tell them that ſay ſo, that as God hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed all neceſſaries to be given us, ſo hath he alſo appointed the means whereby they ſhould be brought to paſs, whereof prayer is a chief means,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170103:134"/>
as appears, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36. 37. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
                     <p>Prayer is a means to recover our peace, and to nouriſh our communion with our God, <hi>Dan. 9. Phil. 4. 6, 7. John</hi> 17. Surely, ſuch as have leaſt care, and make leaſt conſcience of calling upon God, have leaſt acquaintance and acceptance with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 4.</p>
                     <p>Prayer is a Key to open the ſtorehouſes of all Gods treaſury unto us; as by knocking we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the place we deſire to go unto; ſo by prayer we obtain thoſe things we need: prayer is as a hook to reach thoſe things that are above our reach, and to put by thoſe things that ſtand in our way; in a word, it is ſo neceſſary, as without it, the uſe and the enjoyment of the things we have is unlawful, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. For as if we take any thing that is our neighbours, without asking him leave, we are accounted thieves. So to take any thing of Gods (whoſe all things are) without asking them at his hand, is felony, <hi>Ier. 10. 25.

                     <p>PRayer is a jewel of grace bequeathed by Chriſt unto us, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2.

Laſtly, it keepeth the heart in humility, the life in ſobriety; ſtrengthneth all graces, overcometh all corruptions, ſubdueth all temptations, maketh our duties accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, our lives profitable unto men, and both life and death comfortable to our ſelves, <hi>Act. 9. 11. Epheſ. 6. 18. Iude 20. Acts</hi> 4. 24. What ſhall I ſay more for our encouragement to pray unto God but only this? conſider, and that ſeriouſly, the Lord is never worſe, but many times better then his word. <hi>Solomon</hi> did only ask in prayer for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 1 <hi>King. 3. 11, 12. And the Lord gave him more wiſdom then he did ask and riches and honour to boot.</hi> Again, we read, 1 <hi>Sam. 1.

                     <p>So again, for our encouragement to pray, we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. That <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed, ſaying, <hi>Oh that Iſhmael might live before thee, ver.</hi> 19. And God ſaid, <hi>Sarah thy wife ſhall bear thee a ſon indeed,

and thou ſhalt call his name Iſaac, and as for Iſhmael, I will anſwer thy prayer, and make of him a great Nation, ver.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>Again, we read that <hi>Jacob</hi> prayed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 19. and ſaid, <hi>O Lord, if thou wilt give me raiment to put on, and bread to eat, thou ſhalt be my God; and the Lord gave him all that he deſired, and much more, Gen. 32. 10. For with my ſtaff,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>came I over this Jordan, but now I am ſo exceedingly encreaſed in goods, that I am become two bands.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>Again, we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 24, 26. Of one that was in debt ten thouſand talents; and the mony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded, the debtor deſired but dayes of pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Lord forgave him the whole debt, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.</p>
                     <p>Shall I crave leave to inſtance only in one more, then conſider that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

                  <p>PRaiſe or thankſgiving is a reverent acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his mercies, the heart being cheared with ſome taſte of his goodneſs, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth all to come from his mercies, goodneſs, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power, which makes the Soul as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 11. <hi>to rejoice in the Lord, and to ſhout for joy,</hi> Pſal. 107. 8, 15, 21, 31. <hi>O that men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</hi> This is to be done with the Spirit and with underſtanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15.</p>

                  <p>That Singing of Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs is a Goſpel-command, which ought to be performed unto the Lord, and practiſed in and by the Church of Chriſt, and by every particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever as occaſion requires: by ſinging I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a lifting up of the voice with joy: ſee 1 <hi>Chron. 15. 16.

                  <p>That our Singing ought to be performed with a cheerfull heart, and that they only ought to ſing whoſe hearts the Lord hath made glad, the Scriptures do evidently declare: Its ſaid in 2 <hi>Chron 29. 30. That the Levites ſang praiſes with gladneſs, Jer. 31. 7. Sing with gladneſs for</hi> Jacob, <hi>Iſa. 65. 14. Behold my

Servants ſhall ſing for joy of heart,</hi> And it is the expreſs rule of the Apoſtle <hi>James; Is any merry, let him ſing Pſalms; How ſhall we ſing the Lords Song in a ſtrange Land, ſaid the captive Jews, who were required to ſing when they were weeping by the rivers of Babylon, and their Spirits overwhelmed with grief?</hi> Pſal. 137. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>That our ſinging ought to be with grace in the heart, is evident from <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. that is I conceive either with a heart full of the ſenſe of Gods pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and juſtifying grace, or as it is regenerated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and Sanctified by the ſpirit of grace; this is the root of all true Spiritual and heavenly rejoycing, and this hath made the Saints to ſing aloud for joy, <hi>Pſal. 71. 23. my lips ſhall greatly rejoyce, when I ſing unto thee, Pſal. 145. 7. Iſa.</hi> 12. 2. 35. 2. And laſtly, that our ſinging ought to be performed with the ſpirit and underſtanding, is very clear from 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 15.

                  <p>Some objections I have met with, as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the performance of this duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But if it be granted that Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be ſung, what warrant have we to ſing them in meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? and if you have no warrant in the word for ſuch a practiſe, then is it a meer tradition and invention of men: nothing ought to be practiſed in the worſhip of God, but what is warranted by the word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:170103:141"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, that if the Pſalms as they are pen'd and recorded in the book of Pſalms can be ſung ſo as the Church may be edified, and confuſion avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhould judge it an exerciſe very ſuitable to the mind of God, wherein my ſpirit would very freely concur, provided that ſuch Pſalms be ſung, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain matter of praiſe unto God: I have been hitherto of opinion that the Church ought to ſing Pſalms in ſuch a way as they can be ſung by them, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath been found to be in the way of meeter, provided that the putting of them into meeter, doth anſwer, but not obſcure and deſtroy the Senſe and mind of the Holy-Ghoſt as they are left upon record unto us. Now leſt the pleaſantneſs of the voice or tune ſhould more affect the ear, then the Spirituality and ſoundneſs of the matter the heart, the Apoſtle doth caution them, that they ſo ſing, as that they make melody in their hearts unto the Lord, that their hearts be affected and raviſhed as it were with that which their tongues do utter before the Lord; this is that ſinging with grace in our hearts, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. If we are offended with meeter, becauſe there will be ſome variation, or change of words from what they are in the Pſalms, upon record, though they agree never ſo much with the ſenſe of the Spirit of God in them, then may we alſo be offended with our Bibles, and lay them aſide, becauſe one Bible differs from another very much in the tranſlation, as we may find if we compare one reading with another; and yet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed and conſidered, the ſenſe is the ſame, and the mind of the Holy-Ghoſt may be underſtood in either.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſinging of Pſalms and Hymns, muſt be by
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170103:141"/>
an immediate gift of the Spirit, as may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 26, &amp;c.</hi> to ſing a Pſalm or hymn, already penned, ſavoureth too much of formality, and cuſtomarineſs, which ought to be avoided in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is a reprehenſion of ſome diſorders amongſt them in the worſhip of God, and proves nothing at all, that the ſinging of a Pſalm or hymn muſt be by an immediate gift of the Spirit, extemporary and without forethought or premeditation at all. How is it then brethren, when you come together, every one of you hath a Pſalm, hath a Doctrine? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One having made choice of a Pſalm he would ſing, another he would declare a Doctrine, and that at the ſame time, in much confuſion and diſorder, to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Churches peace, therefore he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends them for ſo doing, and cautions them alſo, that all things be done to edifying; but we muſt be ſure the Pſalm or Hymn, for the matter, is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ſtate and condition of the Church, and that there be a ſutableneſs in our ſpirits to utter it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>Of the Ordinance of Baptiſm, another ſtanding Ordinance of the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>THat Baptiſm with water is an Ordinance ſtill in force, is ſo plain and clearly held forth in the Scriptures, that I hear none deny it, unleſs it be the erroneous Quaker, and the voluptuous Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, together with a few new upſtart wantons, that caſt Gods Ordinances behind their backs.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall reduce all I have to ſay to this Ordinance of God, to theſe two heads.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. We ſhall ſpeak ſomething to the eſſence of this Ordinance.</item>
                     <item>2. To the exerciſe of it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. To the eſſence of it; the Ordinances of the Goſpel, whereof this of Baptiſm is one, doth not differ from the Ordinances of the Old Teſtament, in reſpect of the Author, which is the ſame God, the ſubſtance Chriſt, the receivers the people of God, which are in both the ſame, but of continuance, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and eaſie performance and efficacy; in all theſe the Ordinances of the New Teſtament have the greater preheminence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>This Ordinance of Baptiſm was brought into the Church at the command of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 33. by the Miniſtry of <hi>Iohn,</hi> therefore called his Baptiſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 1. afterwards this Ordinance was ſanctified and confirmed by our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, being Baptized by <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 3. 13. and after all this, he gave commiſſion to his Apoſtles and Miniſters to continue the ſame in his Church unto the end,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170103:142"/>
                     <hi>Mat. 28. 18. Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. That the waſhing of the body by water is eſſential to this Ordinance, will appear <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. and that the party be Baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
                  <p>2. The exerciſe of Baptiſm is abundantly held forth to us in the Scriptures of truth, where we have example one upon another.</p>
                  <p>As there is firſt our birth in Chriſt, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our nouriſhment after we are born; ſo the Lord hath appointed two ſeals, or two confirming Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; the one ſealing our regeneration, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and ingrafting into Chriſt, the other ſealing our perſeverance and growth in Chriſt; as in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life we ſee that we need no more but to be born, and then to have this life preſerved: the Ordinance of Baptiſm ſealeth the firſt, and the Lords Supper the ſecond; ſo then Baptiſm is an Ordinance of the New Teſtament, by the waſhing of water, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26 repreſenting the powerful waſhing of the blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. Heb.</hi> 10. 22. and ſo ſealing our regeneration, or new birth, and entrance into the Covenant of grace, and our ingrafting into Chriſt, and into the body of his Church, <hi>John 3. 5. Tit. 3. 5. Act.</hi> 8. 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here let the Reader take notice of the ſimilitudes between the ſign, and thing ſignified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Water is a neceſſary element, the natural life of man cannot be without it, and the blood of Chriſt is as neceſſary to the ſpiritual life of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Water is a comfortable element, the thirſt of the body cannot be quenched but by water. So the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170103:143"/>
thirſt of the ſoul cannot be quenched but by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As water is neceſſary and uſeful, ſo it is a free element, a cheap element, eaſie to come by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coſt, ſo is the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. O he that thirſteth, come and drink freely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. As it is neceſſary, uſeful, and comfortable, and free, ſo it is a common element<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> none are barred from it, any may go to the river and drink. So the blood of Chriſt is offered to all, rich and poor, high and low, none can ſay I am ſhut out or except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Water is copious and plentiful, there is no leſs in the river for thy drinking, there is enough for all men. So is the blood of Chriſt, it can never be drawn dry of his fulneſs. we may all receive, yet he never the more empty, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Water is a cleanſing and purifying element, and it reſembles the blood of Chriſt fitly in that, 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 7. The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from us all ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The inward thing ſignified, is many times really exhibited, and coveyed and ſealed in the uſe of the outward: hence are thoſe expreſſions in Scripture, of being born again of water, and of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. of cleanſing by the waſhing of water, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 29. So again, <hi>ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, Acts</hi> 22. 16. ſo <hi>Rom. 6. 3. we are buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm</hi> Surely the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, being rightly adminiſtred, and rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, doth effect that which it doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould know that confirming Ordinances, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170103:143"/>
or ſeals, properly do not give us any right unto God and his Chriſt, and promiſes, but only ſeal up and confirm that right and intereſt which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready we have in Gods Covenant of Grace: God promiſed to Father <hi>Adam</hi> life, and then he gave him the tree of life, to be a pledge of his promiſe: now it was not the tree of life, that gave <hi>Adam</hi> life, but God according to his promiſe. <hi>Adam</hi> might have lived upon God in the promiſe without the tree, for the tree could do him no good without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Thus God promiſed Chriſt, and his benefits to the believing generation, and then he gave Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to ſeal theſe promiſes. So then it is not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm that ſaves us, but the promiſes; it is not water that purgeth our ſins, but the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; what ſhall I ſay more? where God is pleaſed to diſpenſe his ſeals they are great comforts, and pledges of his love, and where he denieth means and oportunity of enjoying the ſigns, the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified are never the further off, or leſs effectual: <hi>Davids</hi> child died the ſeventh day, a day before the time appointed for circumciſion: and yet both his words and his carriage gives us to underſtand that he doubted not of the ſalvation of it. So the thief upon the croſs, believing in Chriſt, was received with Chriſt into Paradiſe, though he were never baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but he had the inward grace of baptiſm, the waſhing of the blood of Chriſt, though not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſign; ſome have the outward ſign, and not the inward grace, ſome have the inward grace, and not the outward ſign: when God affordeth means, we muſt wait upon him for a bleſſing in them, and by them, as his pipes of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170103:144"/>
and when he doth not afford means, we ſhould not tye the working of his grace to them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things ſeriouſly conſidered, may make any man admire why there ſhould be ſo great contention, jarring, and wrangling about the time when, and the perſons to whom, and the manner how this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is to be adminiſtred: are not the Scriptures as clear in laying down this, as they are in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ordinance it ſelf? now the Scripture being the rule, we are to look for a precept for what we do, otherwiſe the Lord will ſay, who hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe things at your hands? and in the want of a precept, we are to walk by example, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, ye ought ſo to walk as ye have us for an example: in the want of a precept and example, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary directions, inferences and conſequences may be made uſe of, as I might prove at large; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of drawing any of theſe againſt a plain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and example. Now give me leave to preſent a few of thoſe precepts and examples, recorded in the Scripture, for the baptizing of a believer, and when the reader hath anſwered theſe few, I ſhall give him ſo many more for ought I know.</p>
                  <p>1. For precept, conſider theſe three Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. Then <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>repent and be baptized every one of you,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 10. 48. <hi>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.</hi> Acts 22. 16. <hi>And now why tarrieſt thou, ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now here being three precepts for the baptizing of believers, <hi>can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> Acts 10. 47.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:170103:144"/>2. For example, conſider theſe three examples, <hi>Mat. 3. 13, 14, 15. Then cometh Jeſus to John to be baptized, ver. 16. and Jeſus when he was baptized, went up ſtraight way out of the water, and loe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were opened unto him,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 2. 41. <hi>Then they that gladly received the word, were baptized,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 8. 12. <hi>They were baptized both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Behold, here is both precept and example for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of believers, and that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes (and yet ſhall not every word be eſtabliſhed?) Shew me the like for baptizing of children, and I will write a book of recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and acknowledge my error both to God and man: But I am ſure thou canſt not do it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thou wilt make a new Scripture, or groſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this.</p>
                  <p>Let the Reader beware at laſt, that he be not found amongſt the number of thoſe ſpoken of, <hi>Luk. 7. 30. But the Phariſees and Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, being not bapeized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Baptiſm is an Ordinance of the Goſpel, and that only believers hath right unto it, hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: now I ſhall lay down a few reaſons why chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought not to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe we find no command nor example in the word of God, that any Infants were baptized, and we are forbidden to preſume above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and further, if we ſhould admit of any one thing in the worſhip of God, which we find no warrant for in the word of God, we ſhould be forced by the ſame reaſon to admit of many, yea of any inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:170103:145"/>2. As an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nfant is uncapable of examining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of diſcerning the Lords body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not admitted to that Ordinance, ſo alſo he is uncapable of believing and diſcerning the uſe and end of this Ordinance, for there are many things about which Faith is to be exerciſed by him that is baptized. I will inſtance in five.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To exerciſe Faith in the blood of Chriſt for the waſhing away of ſins, See <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Acts 22. 16. Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, calling on the name of the Lord</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Special things held forth in this Ordinance, that a child is not capable of diſcerning, is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical mortification of ſin, <hi>Rom. 6. 3. Know you not that ſo many of us that were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death, ver. 6. knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another thing held forth to us in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is the riſing again unto newneſs of life, <hi>Romans 6 4. Therefore we are buried with him by Eaptiſm, verſe 5. For if we have been plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be raiſed in the likeneſs of his reſurrection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another thing held forth in this Ordinance, is the Baptiſm of the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another thing held forth in this bleſſed Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is the reſurrection of the body, See <hi>Col. 7. 12. Rom.</hi> 6. 5, 8.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe the Reader will grant that a child is not capable of apprehending, believing and applying
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170103:145"/>
theſe and the like things held forth in this Ordinance, and that God requires that ſuch as are baptized, ſhould firſt believe, <hi>Mat. 28. 19. Act. 8. 12, 13, 36, 37, 38. Mat. 3. 6. Act.</hi> 10. 47, 48.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this controverſie is handled at large in other treatiſes, ſuch as deſire further ſatisfaction may have recourſe to them.</p>
                  <p>Now, what art thou doing O man that calleſt me and others Anabaptiſts? for our obedience to God in this bleſſed Ordinance, whileſt thou art rejecting his counſel? if thou ſay, was not I baptized hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? I anſwer, if I were baptized with God-fathers and God-mothers, Common prayer book, Croſs and Surpliſs, and by a Miniſter made by the Biſhops, all which are voted down, as Antichriſtian, and the manner of that Baptiſm was alſo by ſprinkling water upon my face, concerning which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent, how may I be aſſured God will own ſuch a Baptiſm for his Ordinance? Blame me not then if I endeavour to follow Chriſt herein, who was baptized when he came to years, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me ſo to walk, as I have him for an example, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 6. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15, 16. I ſhall cloſe up all that I have to ſay at this time to this Ordinance with two words of advice, the one to thoſe that own Baptiſm according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rule, when people are capable of it; the other to thoſe that rail, mock, and deride the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are baptized, calling them Anabaptiſts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You that have taken up this Ordinance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of laying a greater ſtreſs upon it, then ever God appointed you, <hi>viz.</hi> it was never appointed to break love, and Communion, and to quench the Spirit,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170103:146"/>
and to juſtle out ſome other Ordinances, nor to ſhut out the weak in the Faith, nor to put them upon doubtful diſputations; my brethren, let me tell you, I have rather choſen to weep it out before the Lord in my cloſſet, then to publiſh to the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what I have heard and ſeen amongſt you; what? know you not that all Chriſtians are one in Chriſt, and partakers of one Spirit, promiſes, graces, and have right to all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges? what? know you not that all Saints are fellow-members, fellow-ſouldiers, fellow-travellers, co-heirs, fellow-ſufferers, and fellow-Citizens, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame father, being cloathed with the ſame robe, ruled by the ſame word, inclined to the ſame work? will you ſhut out thoſe that God hath received, and ſtop the mouth that God hath opened, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe communion with thoſe that have fellowſhip with the Father, and the Son, and that are faithful to what they know? are all blind that doth not ſee by your eyes?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You that ſo exceedingly cry up Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and cry down all baptizing of believers. Let me tell you, that through prejudice, weakneſs and blindneſs, you cry up that which you have neither precept nor example for in all the book of God, and cry down that which there is precept upon precept for, and example upon example: I even tremble to think what a ſad account you will give to God for this one day: if you ſay you can prove the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants by neceſſary Deductions from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Inferences, and Conſequences, then let me ask you how you durſt to make uſe of any of theſe to croſs plain precepts and examples.</p>

                     <p>IT is a ſealing or confirming Ordinance of the Goſpel, wherein by the outward elements of bread and wine, ſanctified by the word and prayer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the Miniſter, and rightly received by the communicant, aſſurance is given to thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt, of their continuance in him, and relation to him, receiving nouriſhment by him unto eternal life: or it is a ſecond confirming Ordinance of the New Teſtament, wherein God, by the ſigns of bread and wine, ſignifieth, ſealeth and offereth to every faithful receiver, the body and blood of Chriſt for his ſpiritual nouriſhment and growth in Chriſt; and ſo confirmeth him in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:170103:147"/>The matter of the Lords Supper is partly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as bread and wine, and partly inward, as the body and blood of Chriſt: thoſe outward elements ſignifying Chriſt, and him crucified, with all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his death, paſſion, even whole Chriſt, with all the fruits of his mediation, <hi>Mat. 26. 26, 27. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 25.</p>

                     <head>Wherein doth Baptiſm differ from the Lords Supper, ſeeing they are both confirming Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</head>
                     <p>IN regard of the thing ſignified, Baptiſm, as hath been ſaid, is a ſeal of our entrance into the Church of God: the Supper of the Lord is a ſeal of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the ſame; the one of our new birth, the other of our ſpiritual growth; the former is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this end, that being out of Chriſt by nature, we being born again, might now be ingrafted into his body, <hi>Tit. 3. 5. Joh.</hi> 3. 5. the latter, that being in Chriſt by grace, we might continue and encreaſe in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. and 11. 23. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                     <p>The Supper of the Lord is to be received as often as he ſhall give occaſion: Baptiſm but once, for there is but one entrance into Chriſt, but many degrees of growth up in him.</p>

                     <p>THere ought to be a careful preparation before the action, and great heed in the whole action, and a joyfull and thankful cloſe and ſhutting up of it; all which ought to be performed as well by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter as the people.</p>
                     <p>1. Let there be a due ſearch and tryal of our own ſouls, whether we can find in our ſelves the things which God doth require in worthy communicants, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. by examining our wiſdom and knowledge, both of Gods will in general, and of the nature and uſe of this holy ordinance in particular; whether we can give a reaſon of the repreſentation of Chriſt in the bread and wine, and ſee our need of it, and what we may benefit by it: So alſo we ſhould examine our Faith, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. and repentance, <hi>Heb. 10. 22. James</hi> 4. 8. and ſee whether this to us be attended with the love of God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. and of our Brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 4. and a fervent praying for a bleſſing upon this ordinance of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26.</p>

                     <p>Then he cometh to break the bread and pour out the wine, which doth ſignifie the paſſion of Chriſt, with all the torments which he endured for our ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> to accompliſh our ſalvation: ſee what he endured, conſider that he that was equal with God, ſhould come in the form of a Servant; that he that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heavens could not contain, ſhould be cradled in a manger, that the Judge of all fleſh ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; that the Lord of life ſhould be put to death; that he that was his fathers joy ſhould cry out, <hi>my God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> that that head that was crowned with honour ſhould be crowned with thorns; that thoſe eyes that were as a flame of fire ſhould be cloſed up by the darkneſs of death; that that tongue that ſpake as never man ſpake, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of blaſphemie; that thoſe hands that ſwayed the Scepter, and feet that were as fine braſs, ſhould be nailed to the croſs, and himſelf hanged on a tree between two thieves, and then they pierced his ſide with a ſpear, his precious blood ſhed, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul poured forth unto Death, <hi>Iſa. 53. 5, 10, 12.

                     <p>Then the Miniſter gives the bread and wine to the receivers, which doth ſignifie that God gave Chriſt, and Chriſt gave himſelf to us, and in this is Chriſt Jeſus with all his merits offered to all ſorts of receivers, and that God hath given him unto the faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers

                  <p>THE Church of Chriſt is in Scripture reſembled to a natural body, wherein are many members united to each other, and all to one head by one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, growing up in unity: now as in the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there may be many infirmities, ſo alſo it is in this myſtical body, ſometimes it may be Subject to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers by the drinking in of untruths, ſometimes windy humorus of pride, high-mindedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo diſtemper it, ſometimes a Palſie humor of deadneſs and benummedneſs ſeiſe upon it, ſometimes feave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh fits of violent headineſs may inflame it; but God whoſe temples it is, hath provided for it againſt ſuch diſtempers, whereof this of excommunication is is one. Now if any ask what it is, then I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the caſting of a ſtubborn ſinner out of the Church, and a delivering him unto Satan, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus disfranchized of all the liberties, and depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all the benefits and common ſociety of the Church, is ſeparated as it were from that protection it once had.</p>
                  <p>This ordinance is to be adminiſtred to ſuch as are deſperately wicked, that have nothing profited by the former cenſures, but ſtill continuedin their former wickedneſs of obſtinate and malicious reſiſting all means graciouſly uſed to reclaim them.</p>
                  <p>Now the end of this caſting out is twofold, either reſpecting the good of the perſon excommunicated, or the reſt of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 5. 1 Tim.</hi> 1 20. In the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

together, to deliver ſuch an one unto Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>This muſt be done in wiſdom, tenderneſs, courage and faithfulneſs, to this end, to gain our offending member a gain, and to obey God in this command alſo, praying to God for his bleſſing upon his own ordinance, and that he would keep us from thoſe ſins that we deal with others for.</p>

                  <p>ASSurance is a certain ſweet motion of the ſoul ſteadily reſting upon the mercy of God, through the merits of Chriſt, with an unſhaken expectation of all that is promiſed; this aſſurance in Scripture hath ſeveral denominations, which I ſhall ſpeak to under the next head.</p>
                  <p>Or aſſurance is a victorious concluſion againſt the ſtrength of doubting, whereby the mind of a believer is certained and perſwaded, and upon good grounds ſetled concerning his perſonal intereſt in Chriſt and all his benefits.</p>
                  <p>Aſſurance conquers our doubtings, anſwers our arguments, clears our evidences unto the ſoul, againſt the many ſuſpitions which did ariſe, that Chriſt doth indeed own it, that he is the Saviour thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This aſſurance is called ſometimes full aſſurance of underſtanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes called full aſſurance of hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11, 12, 19.</p>

                  <p>THere are degrees of aſſurance, ſome more weak, ſome more ſtrong; there is an aſſurance, and a full aſſurance. God in his word doth exhort Chriſtians to ſtrive after aſſurance, yea full aſſurance, yea the riches of full aſſurance; and no doubt, that not only <hi>Paul</hi> but many a good Chriſtian can ſay ſometime or other, I am verily perſwaded that Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</p>
                  <p>Aſſurance hath many denominations in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to its degrees; ſometimes it is called a perſwaſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38. Sometimes boldneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 12. In whom we have boldneſs, which doth import an undanted (yet humble and dutiful) looking God in the face.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is called full aſſurance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. That is, when faith doth act ſtrongly, without ſtaggering through unbelief.</p>
                  <p>This is called ſometimes full aſſurance of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2.</p>

                  <p>For Knowledge, Faith and Hope do all contribute their influence to the making up of full aſſurance, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians have ſome degree of aſſurance, who think they have not, and many have no aſſurance at all, who yet pretend thereto moſt of all.</p>

                  <head>The evil of doubting, or want of aſſurance.</head>
                  <p>WE cannot in any one thing more gratifie Satan, and wrong our own ſouls, then to live in a ſtate of doubting; we wrong our ſelves in point of comfort and content, and in point of peace, and in point of boldneſs; a man that lives without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, leaves his ſoul open to many blows and knocks, frowns and wounds, from God, from the world, from carnal friends, and from Satan: beſides, if we live and dye in unbelief, <hi>John 3. 18. He that believeth not, is condemned already:</hi> by the Law, and the Goſpel, and by your own conſcience; all
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170103:163"/>
theſe have paſſed the ſentence of condemnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſtate already: the ſin of unbelief is a great ſin, and it is our ſin to give way to it. We nouriſh a ſnake in our boſom, that will ſting us to death; to doubt and to deſpair of mercy, is to make the God of truth a lyar, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. Doubting makes the countenance ſad, and the hands to hang down, and the knees feeble, and the heart full of fears and trembling; beſides, the time of doubting is a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren time, there is no praying nor praiſing, nor growing, nor any vigorous acting. Surely, this ſtate comes not from God, he bids us make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure; neither doth it come from Chriſt, he ſpeaks and gives peace to his flock, they come not from the holy Spirit of God, for he is the great and moſt ſweet comforter, revealing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the love of God unto the ſoul; conſider theſe Scriptures, <hi>Mat. 14. 31. O thou of little faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore didſt thou doubt?</hi> Luk. 12. 29. <hi>Neither be ye of doubtful minds,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 8. <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up pure hands without wrath, and doubting.</hi> But whilſt we live in the want of aſſurance, we live in a ſtate of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <head>Many think they have aſſurance, and have not.</head>
                  <p>LET us conſider, that there is a great deal of counterfeit knowledge, and counterfeit faith, and counterfeit love, and counterfeit repentance: ſo there is a great deal of counterfeit aſſurance in the world; many there be that talk high, and look big, and bear it out bravely, whereas when their aſſurance comes to be weighed in the ballance, and brought to the teſt, it will be found too light; when it cometh to withſtand temptation, it is found too weak, and when it ſhould put the ſoul upon Divine action, it is found to be but a lazy preſumption; ſo we are apt to think our ſins to be no ſins, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they be many, and that they are but ſmal, when indeed they are great, and that we have grace, when we have none, and that our grace is true, when it is counterfeit, and that our condition is not ſo bad as others, when it is worſe: ſo we are apt to lay claim to God, to Chriſt, and the promiſes, and priviledges, and all the glory of another world, when we are in the ſight of God, poor, and blind, and miſerable, and naked, being Chriſtleſs, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and truthleſs, and ſo think our ſelves to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when we are nothing according to this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
                  <p>Aſſurance is not all kind of perſwaſion, there are two kinds of aſſurance or perſwaſion of the mind touching a mans perſonal intereſt in Chriſt, one is imaginary and deluding, for as the heart of a man
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170103:164"/>
may deceive it ſelf, about the habit of Faith, or any other grace, ſo it may delude a man about the acts and degrees of the ſame; doth the true believer believe in Chriſt? ſo thinks the hypocrite that he doth too: hath a true believer a perſwaſion of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt? ſo hath the hypocrite to a moſt exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confidence, an Iron faith that will never doubt nor bow; it is juſt with him as with a poor man in a dream, what the rich man hath by propriety, that ſame thing may the pooreſt man have in a dream, fancy or imagination.</p>

                  <head>Many reaſons wherefore the Lord doth not give aſſurance ſpeedily.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BEcauſe aſſurance is meat for ſtrong men, babes are not able to bear it, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He doth not give it ſpeedily, becauſe we are apt to ſeek it more for our ſelves, then we do for his honour; as the Sun doth, as it were, put out the light of the Moon, ſtars, fire and candle. So the glory of God muſt put out all other ends; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that minds his wages more then his work, muſt not wonder if his maſter be ſlack in paying him; and ſure it is, that he that is moſt mindfull of Gods honour, God will be moſt mindfull of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another reaſon why he doth not ſpeedily give in aſſurance is, that when they have it they may the more highly prize it, and the more carefully keep it, and the more wiſely improve it, and the more
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170103:164"/>
affectionately and effectually bleſs God for it; none ſets ſuch a prize upon light, as he that hath lain a long time in darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we might live purely upon Chriſt, we are apt to reſt upon every thing below Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to reſt upon creatures, to reſt upon gifts or graces, duties and Divine manifeſtations, or celeſtial conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and to reſt upon gracious evidences: now the Lord to cure his people of theſe diſtempers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times leaves his children of light to walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but let us conſider, that although the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of aſſurance doth make moſt for our comfort, as we have ſaid before: yet the living purely upon Chriſt in the want of aſſurance, doth make moſt for his glory; no Chriſtian to him that in the want of viſibles, can live upon an inviſible God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord moſt times will have his people make a conſtant progreſs in holineſs before he gives them this happineſs of aſſurance, for aſſurance in a ſenſe is the daughter of holineſs.</p>

                  <head>Very hard to recover aſſurance, if one loſt.</head>
                  <p>LET us conſider the wonderful difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering aſſurance if once loſt. Oh the ſighs, the groans, the complaints, the tears, the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentings, the ſoul-bleeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the gaining of aſſurance at firſt coſt very dear, but the regaining of it will put us to more pains and charge. Of the two it is caſier to keep aſſurance when we have it, then to recover it when we have loſt it: as it is eaſier to keep the houſe in reparations, then to raiſe it up when it
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170103:165"/>
is fallen; a man may eaſier make a ſeeing eye blind, then a blind eye to ſee; a man may eaſily put an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument out of tune, but not ſo ſoon put it in again: a man is eaſily born down the ſtream, but cannot ſo eaſily ſwim up the ſtream. It is better to be kept from the loſing of aſſurance, then to be cured; as it is better to be kept from a diſeaſe, then to be cured of a diſeaſe. Oh what is the ſtate of a poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that hath loſt his aſſurance! it will coſt him more grief, ſorrow, heart-breaking, and ſoul-bleeding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſcience will be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quieted, divine juſtice ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and comfort, and joy reſtored, evidences clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pardon in the court of conſcience ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>David</hi> found this to be very hard, which made him cry out, <hi>O ſpare me a little, that I may recover my ſtrength, create a clean heart, renew a right ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation, Pſal.</hi> 51. 7. to 12.</p>

               <p>5. The fifth petition, And forgive us our debts, as even we forgive them that are debtors to us.</p>
               <p>In this petition there is a frank and humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that we have ſinned, and ſtand guilty of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and actual tranſgreſsions, and that there is no power in us to make ſatisfaction ſor our ſins; for by the Law, as by an obligation, every man ſtandeth bound to keep it holy, and continually, <hi>Deut. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10. James</hi> 2. 10. So that the breach thereof even once, and in the leaſt point, maketh us debtors preſently (as having forfeited our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) So that no man can make amends unto God for it, conſidering that whatſoever he doth after the breach, is both imperfectly done, and if it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet it is due by obligation of the Law, and therefore cannot go for payment, no more then a man can pay one debt with another.</p>
               <p>6. The ſixt and laſt petition: And lead us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation but delievers from evil.</p>
               <p>In this petition we pray, that not only our ſin may be pardoned, but alſo that it may be mortified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1, 2. and that we may be either kept from temptation, or preſerved by his grace from being hurt thereby, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 9. The effect of temptation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpecial grace of God, is extreamly evil,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170103:172"/>
to wit ſin and damnation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing we cannot be tempted without the will of God, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 10. nor reſiſt without his power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. If it be his bleſſed will, that he would not let us fall into the one, unleſs he preſerve us in the other, and that he would tie up Satan, and reſtrain his malice and power, or elſe make us wiſe to know and avoid his ſtratagems.</p>

                  <p>THE Lord ſaith in his word, hear the voice of the rod, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 9. which if we did heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve, we might find out the ſin that God ayms at in the affliction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When we find in Scripture that ſuch and ſuch a puniſhment is denounced againſt ſuch and ſuch a ſin, we may find by the effect the proper cauſe; pride with dejection and contempt; whoredom with barrenneſs; idleneſs with poverty; worldly ſorrow with death.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:170103:179"/>2. Conſider, if thou wouldſt find out the ſin God afflicts thee for, conſider God doth puniſh thee by way of retaliation, like for like; as when we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored God, he doth caſt diſhonour upon us, and having wronged our inferiours, our ſuperiors wrong us, or if we laviſh our tongues againſt others, we are paid home with the ſcourge of tongues, thus <hi>David</hi> was juſtly dealt with, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When we are taken in the very act of ſinning, ſo <hi>Jon.</hi> 1. 12. flying, was followed with a tempeſt, and the I ſraelites murmuring for fleſh, were puniſhed by God, whilſt it was between their teeth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 33.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When our ſin in its own nature bringeth forth ſuch a puniſhment, ſo a lazy Chriſtian doth always want four things, comfort and content, confidence and aſſurance. Idleneſs in natural things, brings forth beggery and want, drunkenneſs begets dropſies and ſurreits: ſo the ſin of uncleanneſs brings forth weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and filthy diſeaſes, ſo immoderate carking, is attended with conſumptions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

               <p>But when a man doth that which is evil, and doth ſuffer for it, this is not thank-worthy with God: See theſe Scriptures, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 20. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 15, 19.</p>
               <p>Many men that ſuffer and glory therein, ſuffer only for their faults, and are in no wiſe acceptable to God.</p>

                  <p>GOD is as ſevere in puniſhing as he is gracious in pardoning; his houſe of correction is his School of inſtruction; God had one Son without corruption, but no Son without correction; he had one Son without Sin, but no Son without Sorrow. A Soul may be dearly beloved, although ſoarly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; ſin and puniſhment are linked together; if thou wilt be ſinful, thou muſt be miſerable: Oh what is the ſtate of a man that hath ſinned! it will coſt him more grief, ſorrow, heart-breaking and ſoul-bleeding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſcience will be ſatisfied, comfort reſtored, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences cleared, and pardon in the court of conſcience ſealed: for God can look ſowrly, and chide bitterly, and ſtrike heavily, even where and when he loves dearly; a ſoul may be full of holy affection, when it is empty of divine conſolation; there may be true grace where there is not one drop of comfort, nor one dram of joy.</p>

                  <head>Of Sin, in Sentences.</head>
                  <p>MOſt men are fallen into ſin, as if there were no God to puniſh them, no juſtice to condemn them, no hell to torment them.</p>
                  <p>That man ſhall be a ſlave to ſin, that will not avoid the occaſions of ſin.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible for that man to get the conqueſt of ſin, that plaies and ſports with the occaſions of ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:170103:186"/>It is better to be kept from ſin, then to be cured of ſin; as it is better to be kept from a diſeaſe, then to be cured of that diſeaſe; the greateſt ſinners ſhall be the greateſt ſufferers. Sin ſhall never be our bane, if it be our burden; ſin doth intice us to that which is againſt Gods holineſs, as well as againſt our happineſs, There is no ſin little, becauſe there is no little God to ſin againſt.</p>
                  <p>There is many a one full of ſinful corruption, that ſhews it not for want of occaſion; but the more grace thrives in the Soul, the more ſin dies in the ſoul: Sin may break our Communion, but not our Union with God.</p>
                  <p>Every ſin doth put God upon complaining, Chriſt upon bleeding, and the ſpirit upon grieving, and ſo men go on from folly to folly, till they be ripe for eternal miſery.</p>

                  <p>THE Devil aims principally to make us walk ſinfully, that ſo we might live uncomfortably. If Satan be alwaies roaring, we ſhould be alwaies watching, for though Satan cannot rob a Chriſtian of his crown, yet he will endeavour to ſpoil him of his comfort: It is not Satans tempting, but our conſenting, not his inticing, but our yielding, that makes tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſinful.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us not yield to Satans temptations, who hath the worſt name, and the worſt nature of all created creatures: our carnal ſecurity is his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; and he that would not be taken with Satans deviſes, let him make preſent reſiſtance againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans firſt motions.</p>

                  <head>Of aſſurance of Salvation, in Sentences.</head>
                  <p>A Sſurance is a ſalve for every ſore, and a remedy for every malady; a Chriſtians anchor at ſea, and his ſhield at land, a ſtaff to ſupport him, a ſword to defend him, and a pavilion to hide him.</p>
                  <p>Aſſurance makes heavy afflictions light, and long afflictions ſhort, and bitter afflictions ſweet; God hath made an everlaſting ſeparation between ſin and peace, ſin and joy, ſin and aſſurance; if ſin and our ſouls be one, God and our ſouls muſt needs be two.</p>
                  <p>He that will get aſſurance, muſt mind his work more then his wages, for aſſurance is heavenlywages,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170103:188"/>
that God gives not to loiterers, but to the ingenious labourers.</p>
                  <p>Though no man merits aſſurance by his obedience, yet God uſually crowns obedience with aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>That ſoul will never attain to any ſettled aſſurance of Salvation, that builds his hopes upon a ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; We cannot diſtruſt our ſelves too much, nor truſt Chriſt too much.</p>
                  <p>It is one thing for God to love a ſoul, and another thing for God to aſſure that ſoul of his love.</p>
                  <p>A man may be truly holy, and yet not have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he ſhall be eternally happy.</p>
                  <p>God writes many a mans name in the book of life, and yet not let him have aſſurance of it till the hour of death; aſſurance is a mercy too good for moſt mens hearts, a crown too weighty for moſt mens heads. It is the beſt and greateſt mercy, and therefore God will only give it to his neareſt and deareſt friends. As faith is often attended with unbelief, and ſincerity with hypocriſie, and humility with vain glory, ſo is aſſurance with fears and doubts.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and take in three things, Knowledge in the mind, Malice in the heart, perſecuting ſome known Truths, and perſevering therein: for the proof of this, let me inſtance in three Scriptures, firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> was filled with malice in his heart; but although a ſcholar, he had no knowledge in his mind, as the text ſaith, he had mercy on me becauſe I did it ignorantly; now <hi>Peter</hi> he had much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in his mind, but no malice in his heart, and ſo although he ſinned out of knowledge, yet he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not this ſin, but upon the crowing of the cock, and Chriſts looking on him, he repenteth; now take the knowledge that was in <hi>Peter,</hi> and joyn it with the malice that was in <hi>Paul,</hi> and in both theſe perſecute the truth, and perſevere therein, this is that grand ſin, for that grand ſin hath theſe three properties, 1. Knowledge. 2. Malice. 3. Perſeverance in a way of wickedneſs, for finalneſs, maliciouſneſs, and univerſalneſs muſt be taken joyntly together, not ſeverally one from another, if by them we would deſcribe the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; for a man may fall knowingly and maliciouſly, yet unleſs he fall finally, and ſo make a defection from the truth, not through fear or infirmity, but out
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170103:192"/>
of hatred, blaſphemy, and perſecution; if he come not up to this, he hath not committed this ſin, for we find all the former ſins to be pardonable.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Julian</hi> that committed this ſin, that he was from his child-hood trained up in piety, and attained to great knowledge, and when he came to the Empire, he carryed himſelf with much clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but after this, he came to deny Chriſt in <hi>France,</hi> and turned a moſt bloody butcher, and barbarous perſecutor to poor Chriſtians; after this being either wounded in a battle, or a blow from heaven, he took a handfull of his blood, and flung it up into the air, and burſt out into a moſt wicked experſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Chriſt, and ſaid, thou man of <hi>Galilee,</hi> thou haſt overcome me, and ſo miſerably dyed.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How could Chriſt, being but one, make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the ſins of ſo many?</p>

I hope you will grant that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was as well able to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, as the firſt was to putrifie; for though Chriſt was but one, yet he was ſuch a one as was greater and better then all, and ſo able, and ſufficient to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170103:192"/>
for all, and to redeem all as well as he made all; and the blood of ſuch a one as Chriſt, the ſon of God, was of ſuch an infinite value and price, that it did ſurmount and ſurpaſs in dignity and worth, all the ſouls in the world; and his ſufferings and merits were a ſufficient ſatisfaction, if intended and applyed to that end for to ſave ſo many worlds of men, as there is men in the world.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> He did ſatisfie and perform for his people what the Law could require and exact from them, and ſo became the end of the Law, for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs or Juſtification, to every one that believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. And ſo redeemed and freed them from the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word All, is not to be alwaies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for every one; for the word All hath many reſtrictions; for this word All is very often taken in Scripture for all kinds, as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth, that ſupplication be made for all men, that is, ſome of all ſorts and degrees, as well Rulers as others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1.

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170103:193"/>
kind of wiſdom; ſo we read, that Chriſt healed all diſeaſes, that is, all manner of diſeaſes; All is ſometimes reſtrained in Scripture to Gods peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people; Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will draw all men to me, John</hi> 12. 32. That is, all men that the Father gave him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 4, 5. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 13. Again we read, they ſhall be all taught of God, not all the world ſure, but all Gods people: Again, <hi>I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, Acts</hi> 2. 7. Theſe cannot be meant of all the wicked: Again we read, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 15. They pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men, that is, all good men: Again we read, <hi>Mat. 10. 22. Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake,</hi> that is, of all wicked men; by which we may ſee how the word All is taken vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and therefore it is to be limited, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to perſons and things, according as the text will bear, and no otherwiſe; and when as it is ſaid, he taſted death for every man, it is to be taken for many, for inſtance, <hi>Cant. 3. 8. Every man had his ſword on his thigh.</hi> Mic. 4. 4. <hi>Every man ſhall ſit under his Vine.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5. <hi>Every man ſhall have praiſe of God:</hi> Now conſider, every man in the world had not a ſword to wear, nor a Vine to ſit under, neither ſhall every man have praiſe of God; ſo every man is not to be taken, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in the world particularly: but if it were granted that Chriſt taſted death for every man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and that all have ſome Benefit by the death of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Their natural lives, and the poſſeſſion of the creatures, yet it doth not follow, if he taſted death for every man, that therefore he ſuffered the wrath of God for every man, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170103:193"/>
the puniſhment due to all for their ſins, <hi>Mat. 27. 34. He taſted the vinegar mingled with gall, but he would not drink it:</hi> and may there not be ſome myſterie held out thereby to the point in hand? you that are ſpiritual, Judge.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, and there is no man that doth avoid ſo much evil, and do ſo much good as he ought and might: conſider that to ſome the Lord doth give natural Talents, as Wiſdom, Wealth, Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to other ſpiritual Talents or Gifts, as to Pray, Propheſie, Interpret; and God may very juſtly damn men for not improving what he g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

John 3. 36. Luke</hi> 19. 27. Compared with <hi>Rom 1. 20, 21. Rom.</hi> 2. 15. Theſe Scriptures compared together will prove the whole anſwer to this queſtion.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How came the Sabbath day to be changed from the ſeventh day to the firſt, and from a Sabbath day to the Lords day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By divine authority, as may appear by the practice of our Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170103:194"/>
                     <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. compared with <hi>Act. 20. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. This is the day they preached, prayed, brake bread, and collected for the poor.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it came to be called the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe the ſpecial dedication thereof was to the Lords ſervice.</p>
                  <p>So then this day was changed from the ſeventh to the firſt, and from a Sabbath to a firſt or Lords day, becauſe it might ſerve for a thankful memorial of Chriſts reſurrection: for as God reſted from his Labour on the laſt day of the week, ſo Chriſt ceaſed from his labour and afflictions on this day, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. As the one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſpecially ſanctified, in regard of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world, ſo was the other in reſpect of the reſtauration and redemption of the world, which of the two is a greater work then the Creation.</p>
                  <p>So then the ſourth Commandment doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſeventh day from the Creation, but a ſeventh day in general: ſo then it doth not hence follow that we ſhould reſt the ſame day the Lrod reſted, but that we ſhould reſt from our works one day in ſeven, as he reſted from his; which day under the Law he appointed to be the laſt day of the week; ſo nothing hindereth but by his ſpecial appointment under the Goſpel, it may be the firſt day, and yet the ſubſtance of the Commandment nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: if any reply and ſay, why doth not the new Teſtament mention this change? I anſwer, becauſe we read of no queſtion moved about the ſame in the Apoſtles time: ſo then a Sabbath day, the Lords day, or the firſt day of the week, which is all
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170103:194"/>
one, is conſtantly and perpetually to be obſerved, and never to ceaſe till it be perfectly conſummated in the heavenly Sabbath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9, 10.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is undoubtedly the duty of a wicked man to pray, and the Priviledge of a Chriſtian that he can do it, though they that have no faith, cannot ſeek Chriſt as they ought; yet it is their duty to pray and to ſeek after Chriſt, <hi>Pſal. 79. 6. Pour out thy wrath upon the Heathen that have not known thee, and upon the Kingdoms that have not called upon thy name:</hi> So again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. If the not calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of God be a ſin, then to call upon the name of God is a duty: Hence <hi>Peter</hi> calls upon <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. 22.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Phariſee and the Publican both went to the Temple to pray, Luke</hi> 18. 10. So again <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi> 31. 18. Yet not converted, prays unto the Lord to turn him. Again, we may ſee 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21. 27. Ahab <hi>humbled himſelf, and rent his cloaths, and put ſack-cloath upon his fleſh, and faſted, ver. 29. I will not ſaith the Lord bring the evil in his daies, but in his ſons daies I will bring the evil upon his houſe.</hi> So then it doth plainly appear, that it is the duty of all men to pray, only it is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the regenerate, they can pray in the ſpirit, and with underſtanding too: a Chriſtians ſeeking of God, is the effects of Gods ſeeking of him; and a mans praying before faith, is the effect of the common work of the ſpirit; our ſeeking after faith, is the effect of the ſaving work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; external Actions ſhall have externall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; ſpiritual actions ſhall have ſpirituall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The Lord doth cauſe the Sun to ſhine, and the rain to fall upon them, therefore beware of judging and condemning them: are they proud? who can tell but God may humble them: are they unclean? who can tell but God may cleanſe them: we ought to be courteous in our behaviour towards them, <hi>Gen. 23. 7, 12. Abraham bowed himſelf to the people of the Land,</hi> Chriſt was tender hearted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, he wept over them that were to ſhed his blood: and we are to own and commend what there is of God in them: ſo it is ſaid, Chriſt did love the young man in the Goſpel, for thoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts that there were in him. God is the fountain of common gifts, as well as of ſaving grace. The Lord doth make uſe of them, to bring out of their loyns many precious men: and ſometimes he doth
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:170103:202"/>
make uſe of them, to help the woman, and ſometimes to awaken his people, and put them upon their guard: but in all our converſings with wicked men, take heed to theſe things. (1.) Walk warily and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly before them, <hi>Phil. 2. 15. For you are in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 12. <hi>Having therefore your converſation honeſt amongst the Gentiles,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing, we put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> (2) Beware of envying at their proſperity, becauſe God hath prohibited that, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37. 1. Conſider, they have their reward here in this life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 19. There is no reward to a wicked man in another life. (3.) Beware of cracking a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to procure their favour, as <hi>Judas</hi> did: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their favour is fickle, and it is a madneſs to loſe the favour of God, to gain the favour of his enemies. (4.) Beware of omitting thoſe duties that God requires of you for fear of them: this is to life up man more then God. Conſider, omiſſion may damn a man, as well as commiſſions, and hereby we ſhall gratifie carnal men, by omitting of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for fear of them: and by this we ſhall ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thoſe that were coming on in the wayes of God. (5.) Beware of too deep a familiarity with them, and that for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe they have no communion nor fellowſhip with God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. They are without Chriſt in the world, and have communion with Satan, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. The whole world lyeth in wickedneſs.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have ſpoken to Election before in its place, but ſeeing here are more particulars, then there I have ſpoken unto, I ſhall anſwer each briefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to election what it is? conſider that it is a ſpecial decree of God, touching the conferring of eternal ſalvation, by Chriſt the Redeemer, to certain men of meer mercy and good will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the cauſes of election, it is the love of the Trinity, God Almighty, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt. The manner of working peculiarly to each of them: the Scripture expreſly ſheweth that the Father and the Son did elect us, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 4. John</hi> 15. 16. In which we may not exclude the Holy Ghoſt, who
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:170103:204"/>
hath one common God-head with them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. So that the cauſe which moved God to elect, was his meer good will, and nothing elſe, as appears by theſe enſuing undeniable reaſons.</p>
                  <p>1. By the word of God, he hath predeſtinated us, according to the good pleaſure of his will, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 5. Rom.</hi> 11. 5.</p>
                  <p>So then we are not elected for foreſeen faith, for every cauſe is before the effect, now faith is after election, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48.</p>
                  <p>So in the next place we are not elected for any foreſeen works, for the Apoſtle doth exculde all works from being either cauſes of election or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 9. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>3. The ends of election may be reduced to theſe three heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The glory of God, and the celebration, and declaration of his mercy, <hi>Romans 9. 23. Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond end is, that we ſhould be ho. ly, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. He did not chuſe us becauſe we were then holy, but that we might be holy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third end is the ſalvation and glory of the elect, therefore they are ſaid to be ordained to eternal life, and prepared unto glory, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen unto ſalvation, <hi>Acts 13. 48. Rom. 9. 23. 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The effects of election, are the mediation of Chriſt, adoption, vocation, ſaving faith, juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, glorification, in a word, Gods election is the root of all gifts of God in us, and the foundation of all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits beſtowed upon us.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Juſtification is a gracious work of God, whereby he judgeth the elect to be juſt by faith in Chriſt, through the imputation of his juſtice, and that unto the praiſe of his glorious grace, given us in Chriſt before the world began.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt they agree in their cauſe, for God is the Author of them both, through the merits of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Now as they do accord in ſome things, ſo they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in other things, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. In that juſtification is out of man, Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is within him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Juſtification abſolveth a ſinner, whereby he ſeeth he ſtandeth righteous at the bar of Gods juſtice; ſanctification, makes us ſtand righteous in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Juſtification brings peace of conſcience, ſo doth not ſanctification but puts us upon following that peace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Juſtification conſiſts in the imputation of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to us; Sanctification in the infuſion of right principles, that we might walk holily to right ends.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Juſtification is acted at once, ſanctification is done by degrees: the former is in this life perfect, the latter is imperfect.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They differ in reſpect of the manner in which they are wrought, for juſtification is wrought by the right of donation, but ſanctification is by the way of practical alteration.</p>

               <head>Of the Miſeries attending both body and ſoul in the hour of death, if they ſee not their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt.</head>
               <p>DEath in the Scripture is called the King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and the fear of death makes many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bondage all their life, for death is a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that hath ſomething to ſay to every man, and he often ſpeaks to all, that would fain be heard, but moſt men are not at leiſure to hear what he hath to ſay, no, not till old age, nor then neither; well, after all the forementioned troubles, in comes death, and looks the old man grim and black in the face, and neither pittieth his age, nor regardeth his long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured Dolours, but battereth all the principal parts of his body, and arreſteth him to appear before the great judge of Heaven and Earth, at the bar of his Juſtice; then the old man fals into a cold ſweat over all his body, and a trembling in all his members; the head aketh, the face waxeth pale, the noſe black, the eye-ſtrings break, the tongue faltereth, the throat rotleth: whilſt he is thus ſummoned to appear at the great aſſize of Gods court, behold a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seſſions, and goal Delivery is held within him; where reaſon ſits as Judge, and his conſcience being now awakened, puts in a bill of Inditement; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is alleadged, all the evil deeds that ever thou haſt committed, and the good deeds that ever thou haſt omitted, and all the curſes, and Judgements that are due to every ſin: Never ſuch a bill put up againſt the greateſt Traitor in any court of men; thou muſt
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:170103:211"/>
hold up thy hand at the bar, for all the ſins that ever thou didſt commit in the whole courſe of thy life; the bill of Indictment it ſelf runs thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thou art accuſed for many ſins of omiſſion, in leaving undone many good things, that God in his word required of thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For ſpoiling all the good things that ever thou didſtin thy life, by mixing the poyſon of thy own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For ſinning in ſecret, as if God had not ſeen it, becauſe men do not; and hereby denying, as it were, Gods Omnipotency.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For preſuming ſometimes to ſin openly to the Diſhonouring of the God of Glory, before all the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For ſinning againſt all ſorts of men, againſt thy Parents in thy youth, thine equals in thy manly age, thine inferiours in thy old Age.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For ſinning againſt God himſelf immediately, by abuſing his Name and Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For ſinning againſt mens Souls, Lives, Goods, Chaſtity, good Name, and all that was near and dear to them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For ſinning againſt thy own ſoul, and all the good things God hath given thee, by intemperance, and otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For ſinning againſt Gods holy Ordinances, in neglecting or abuſing them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For ſinning againſt Gods Mercies, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Health, Wealth, and Liberty, and Parts, and Gifts.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For ſinning againſt Gods Judgements, as if thou
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170103:211"/>
caredſt not for his pleaſure, nor fearedſt his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For ſinning againſt the checks of thy own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that often forbad thee to ſin, but could not be heard.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For ſinning againſt the motions of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo putting the Lord upon complaning, and Chriſt upon bleeding, and the Spirit upon griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For drawing others to ſin, by thy bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and counſels.</p>
               <p n="15">15. For incouraging them in their ſins, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of them.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For not reproving them for ſin, as if thou waſt afraid to ſpeak for God, againſt thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For not puniſhing ſin, where thou hadſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority, and waſt required to do it.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For a world of precious time, that thou haſt miſpent in the world.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For a multitude of unknown ſins, that thou hadſt totally forgotten, committed in the child-hood, youth and man-hood; all thy omiſsions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions will then come into thy mind, and if thou wouldeſt, thou canſt not put them out; I know of two precious Chriſtians, being a long time weak, and like to dye, that did witneſs to this truth; all the ſins of their youth that they had forgotten, came in remembrance as freſh as if but now commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And laſtly, there comes in a long bill, that thou never dreamedſt of, much leſs, couldeſt repent of; ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance will be no plea in this court, God will ſay,

thou oughteſt and mighteſt have known al theſe things to be ſinful, out of the holy Scripture; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art utterly unexcuſable. Oh conſider, if ever any bill were like to this, and bring it home to your own conſciences, for it is your own caſe; it is true, that in all courts of Juſtice, exception againſt witneſſes is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, but thou canſt except againſt none of theſe, except it be the Devil, who bears malice to thee; yet malice is a good informer, though a bad Judge; but to caſhier his teſtimony, what canſt thou ſay againſt thy partners in ſin? do not they know all thy waies? what canſt thou ſay againſt good men, that with grief beheld thy ſinfull courſes? what againſt good Angels, that will not belie thee? what canſt thou ſay againſt thy own conſcience? what canſt thou ſay againſt the moſt true and knowing God, that cannot lie?</p>
               <p>And whilſt thy ſoul is thus within, out of peace and order; thy wife, children and friends trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee as faſt, to have thee put thy goods in order, ſome crying, ſome craving, ſome pittying, ſome chearing well; In this extremity, the ſoul looks eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way for help, and ſhe finds her ſelf every way helpleſs: I ſhall here acquaint the Reader, of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that I read at leaſt twenty years ago; which God made of great uſe to me, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this miſery, deſires to hear the leaſt word of Comfort; ſhe directs this or the like ſpeech to the Eyes: Oh Eyes, who in times paſt were ſo quick ſighted, can you ſpie no comfort? not any way how I might eſcape this dreadful danger? Alas, the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings are broken, they cannot ſee the candle that burneth, nor diſcern whether it be day or night.</p>

                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:170103:212"/>The ſoul finding no comfort in the eyes, ſpeaks to the ears; Oh Ears, who were willing and wont to recreate me with hearing new pleaſant diſcourſes, and muſick, can ye hear the tidings of the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for me? but the ears are either ſo deaf, that they cannot hear at all; of the ſenſe of hearing is grown ſo weak, that it cannot endure to hear his deareſt friends to ſpeak; So the ear cannot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter any comfort: Then ſhe intimates her grief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Tongue; Oh Tongue, who was wont to bring it out with the braveſt, where are now thy big and daring words, now in my greateſt need? canit thou ſpeak nothing in my defence? canſt thou neither daunt theſe enemies with threatning words, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them with fair ſpeeches? But alas, the tongue cannot in his greateſt extremity, ſo much as call for a little drink, or deſire a friend to take away with his finger the flegm that is ready to choak him.

But alas, the Feet are as it were dead already; if they be not ſtirred, they cannot ſtir. Then ſhe directs her ſpeech unto her hands; Oh hands, who have been ſo often approved for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in Peace and War, wherewith I have ſo often defended my ſelf, and offended my Foes; never had I more need then now; Help now, or I periſh for ever: But alas, the Hands are ſo weak, and do ſo trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they cannot reach to the mouth a ſpoonfull of ſupping to relieve languiſhing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

to move, though it be moſt ſwift of motion. The God of Mercy hath utterly forſaken me, and the Devil who knows no mercy waites for me; my joyes in this life were gone before I could ſcarce enjoy them; my miſeries are eternal, and never ſhall know end: Oh that I had ſpent the hours that I conſumed in carding, dicing and other exerciſes, in reading the Scriptures, in hearing Sermons, and meditating thereon; in conferring with the Lords people, in weeping for my ſins, in faſting, watching and praying, and beliveing; that I might have now departed in the aſſured hope of everlaſting ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Oh that I were now to begin my life again, how religious and purely would I lead my life! But now my glaſs is out, the Sun is ſet, the golden Scepter is taken in, once I had a reconcileable God, bowels of Mercy were not totally reſtrained, but Repentance might have enlarged them: The treaſury door of Mercy and Grace was not lockt up, but Faith could have opened it, and the hour of Grace might have procured the oyl of Gladneſs; and there was ſtill a blank in the leaf, for the ſinners name to be put in upon coverſion, but now every door of hope is ſhut and lockt up, and now is my caſe more miſerable then the beaſt that periſheth in the ditch; for I muſt go to anſwer before the Judgement ſeat of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judge of heaven and earth, where I ſhall have none to ſpeak for me, and I cannot excuſe my ſelf; my own heart already condemns me, I muſt needs therefore be condemned before his Judgement ſeat: me thinks I hear that doleful ſentence, <hi>Mat. 25. 41.

               <head>Of the ſad Condition and Miſery of all out of Chriſt after death.</head>
               <p>ANd here I ſhall not ſay much, but only give the Reader a taſt of that ſtate, and then ſpeak at large to this thing, towards the cloſe of this book, when we ſpeak of the laſt Judgment and end of all things. Now the miſery of the ſoul after death, is either particular or general: particular is that which liteth upon the ſoul immediately, as ſoon as ſhe is ſeparated from the body, ſhe is ſaid to ſtand before the throne of God, and ſo forthwith ſhe is carried by the evil Angels with violence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, where ſhe is kept as in a priſon, in everlaſting pains and chains, under darkneſs unto the Judgement of the great day: but not in that extremity of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which ſhe ſhal receive at the laſt day; there thy laſcivious eyes ſhall be afflicted with ſights of ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirits: Thy curious ears ſhall be affrighted with hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous noyſe of howling Devils, and the gnaſhing teeth of damned Reprobates: thy dainty noſe ſhall be cloyed with noyſom ſtench, thy delicate taſte ſhall be pined with intolerable hunger, and thy drunken throat ſhall be parched with nnquenchable thirſt, thy mind ſhall be tormented to think how fooliſhly thou haſt loſt heaven, and gotten helliſh pains for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary riches; thou haſt loſt the eternal treaſure, and changed heavens felicity for hells fury; where thou ſhalt have puniſhment without pitty, miſery without mercy, ſorrow without ſuccour, crying without comfort, miſchief without meaſure, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without eaſe, where the worm dyeth not,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170103:215"/>
and the fire is never quenched, where the wrath of God ſhall fall upon the ſoul and body, as the flame of fire doth on the Lump of pitch or brimſtone, in which flame thou ſhalt ever be burning, and never conſumed: ever dying, and never dead; ever roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the pangs of death, and never rid of thoſe pangs: this is the ſecond death, which every damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reprobate muſt ſuffer, ſo long as God and his Saints ſhall enjoy bliſs and felicity in Heaven for evermore. Hitherto of the miſery of man in the ſtate of corruption: now followeth the means that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould uſe to eſcape this ſad condition; that they may not go out as the ſnuff of a candle, but lay down their lives in peace; in aſſurance, or at leaſt ſome hope of their ſalvation.</p>

Oh how wilt thou do to lanch out into the Ocean! doſt thou know what will become of thee in another world? is thy peace made with God? is thy perſon juſtified? art thou in a ſtate of grace? art thou born again? art thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and become as a little child? haſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented? doth thy righteouſneſs exceed that of the Scribes and Phariſees? if ſo, it is well; if not, thou ſhalt never enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>John 3. 3. 5.

Let us conſider, that death to a godly man is but a change of place, not of company; we ſhall have the company of the ſame Father, Son and Spirit, and Saints, and all the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: a believer in this world is not in his own place, therefore oh Chriſtians, weigh anchor, hoiſe ſail, and be gone: death to a Chriſtian will put an end to all unprofitable things here we change joy for ſorrow, health for ſickneſs, ſtrength for weakneſs, honour for diſhonour, plenty for poverty, beauty for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, friends for foes, ſilver for braſs, gold for copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now death puts an end to all theſe, <hi>Rev. 21. 4. And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death nor ſorrow, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall there be any more pain,</hi> Rev. 14. 13. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord:</hi> death alſo doth put a change to our employment, our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in this world doth lye much in praying, groaning, ſighing, mourning, wreſtling, and fighting againſt the world, fleſh and Devil, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 10. But in the world to come, our employment will lye in praiſing and magnifying the Lord: Again, our enjoyment ſhall be changed, as well as our employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall change our unconſtant enjoyment for a more conſtant, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17, 18. We ſhall change our dark and obſcure enjoyment, for a more bright enjoyment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.

               <p n="6">6. Conſider unto what familiar things death is compared and preſented, to one that is in Chriſt; ſometimes it is termed a houſe, <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, I know that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:170103:217"/>
thou wilt bring me to death, and to the houſe of all living, <hi>Job</hi> 30. 23.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is repreſented as going to bed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 2. Sometimes death is ſtiled a ſleep, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay more, death to a wicked man is the king of terrors; but Chriſt came to deliver his flock from the fear of death, and the grave is embalmed by Jeſus Chriſt, he lay there three dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>2. As in our preparation for death, there are the foregoing things to be conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo in the next place, there are ſome things to be practiced, and the work we have is two-fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Get a title to Gods love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Get aſſurance that thou haſt a title, which is, or may be done by improving theſe five things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Improve the preſent opportunity, and put not off to the laſt minute as moſt do.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Store up a ſtock of faith, ſtore up a ſtock of promiſes, and ſtore up a ſtock of prayers againſt that day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Endeavour ſo to live every day, as if it were thy laſt day.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Gather up all thy evidences and ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and keep them in mind and heart.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Make thy will in time of health, and leave all things clear upon thy book, both in ſhop and conſcience.</p>
               <p>1. In all thy gettings, be ſure to get a title to Gods love, and then get aſſurance that thou haſt a title; the firſt is done by action, the ſecond is done by examination.</p>

                  <head>The action or actions are theſe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. GIve diligence to make thy calling and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. and that a man may ſo do, ſhorten worldly buſineſs, and be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the uſe of worldly pleaſures: ſo fooliſh are we, that whilſt with much care and labour, we go about to make thoſe things certain, which are moſt uncertain: we make thoſe things uncertain which might be made moſt certain: he that hath two Irons in the fire at once, ſpoyls one whilſt he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the other. See what care moſt have to make good their titles, to ſettle their inheritances upon their heirs: ſhall we not be as careful to ſettle our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to eternal glory? if we be quiet now, yet the Devil will find a time to try thy evidences for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and call our title into queſtion; ſickneſs and death are times of weakneſs to us, wherin he like a ſubtile enemy, diſplayes all his art. O conſider the miſery of doubting perſons at their death, think upon the anguiſh that their ſouls endure, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God angry with them, the Devil accuſing them, earth leaving them, heaven refuſing them, hell claiming them, ſoul and body parting, friends weeping, and themſelves hopeleſs, going they know not whither. O then, O then let us make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure before hand: as worldly men get riches in health to cheriſh them in ſickneſs, and as the Bees get hony in ſummer, to feed on in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; even ſo ſhould we in time of health get good grounds of aſſurance, that ſo we might live, enjoy,

Rev.</hi> 14. 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we would dye comfortably, let us improve the preſent opportunity; for we have a great deal of work to do, and but a little time to do it in; this work deferred will be ſtill greater, the time
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:170103:218"/>
to do it in will be ſhorter, the ſtrength to do it by will be leſs, our underſtanding will be more dark, our hearts more hard, our wils more crooked, our affections more diſordered, our conſcience more benummed: the work we have to do is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>viz.</hi> We have a God to honour, a Chriſt to reſt on, a race to run, a crown to win, a hell to eſcape, a heaven to obtain: we have weak graces to ſtrengthen, and ſtrong corruptions to weaken, we have many temptations to withſtand, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to bare, we have many mercies to improve, and many ſervices to perform.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Heſter</hi> had not improved the preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, ſhe and her fathers houſe had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>

                  <p>There was an opportunity that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had to enter in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> upon the return of the ſpies, but they not improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, were fain to ſtay longer in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>

                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had an opportunity to be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but for want of improving it, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Let us now redeem the time, leſt our candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick be removed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5.

Yet the bridegroom tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth and waiteth, let us haſt to enter in with him, leſt with the fooliſh Virgins we be repelled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 12. Yet wiſdom cryeth in our ſtreets, Oh then, now let us harken to her.

                  <p>4. The next thing to be practiced of all that would live ſweetly, and dye comfortably, is, firſt, ſtore up a ſtock of faith. Secondly, ſtore up a ſtock of promiſes. Thirdly, ſtore up a ſtock of prayers, and thou ſhalt attain the art of dying well.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Store up a ſtock of faith, and that will ſhew
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:170103:219"/>
us that Chriſts death is a death concerning death, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 56, 57, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt in his death put death to death. Again, faith will aſſure the dying party, that the Lord will be with him in the hour of death, <hi>Pſalm 23. 4. Though I walk in the valley of death, I will fear none ill, &amp;c.</hi> Again, faith will make a Chriſtian willing to dye, <hi>Luke 2. 28, 29. Now let thy ſervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Store up a ſtock of promiſes againſt that day; I will be with thee in the fire and in the water, ſaith the Lord in one promiſe, and in another promiſe he ſaith, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee; the labour of the Olive may fail, our neareſt and deareſt friends may fail, our eyes may fail, our tongue may fail, our ſtrength may fail, our fleſh and heart may fail, our ſpirits may fail; yet ſaith the Lord, I will be with thee, I will not fail thee; ſee theſe precious Scriptures, <hi>Joſh. 1. 5. Joſh. 21. 45. and 23. 14. 1 King.</hi> 8. 56.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Store up a ſtock of prayers; amongſt all thy requeſts to God, in all thy addreſſes to him, intreat him not to forſake thee at that time.</p>
                  <p>5. The fifth thing to be practiced, is to endeavour to live every day as thy laſt day, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of death, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. ſee what follows, <hi>ver. 12. So teach me to number my dayes, that I may apply my heart to wiſdom:</hi> a natural man conſiders of death notionally, their ſenſes tell them that all muſt dye, but as for preparation for it, that they put off till the laſt year, and when that is come, to the laſt moneth, and when that is come, to the laſt week of that moneth, and when that is come, to the laſt
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:170103:220"/>
day of that week, and when that is come, to the laſt hour of that day, and when that is come, to the laſt minute of that hour, and ſo knock when the gate is ſhut, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 12. the gate of grace is ſhut, and the gate of mercy, and the gate of indulgence, and the gate of repentance, and the gate of hope, and the gate of comfort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let a Chriſtian live every day as his laſt day, and make ſure his intereſt in God, whilſt God is reconcilable, and whilſt his bowels of mercy are not totally reſtrained, and whilſt the treaſury door of mercy and grace is open, and whilſt there is a blank in the leaf for the ſinners name to be put in, before the glaſs is out, and the Sun ſet, and the golden ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken in.</p>
                  <p>6. Gather up all thy evidences and ſpiritual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, and keep them in thy heart and memory, and ſtand on thy guard, having put on all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Chriſt; as a valiant ſouldier, conſtantly maintain war, and thou ſhalt uſually obtain victory; reſolve in the ſtrength of Chriſt, either to conquer, or dye conquering; for let no man think to dance and dine with the Devil, and afterwards to ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore live in Chriſt, and not in our ſelves, for in our ſelves there is a body of luſt, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and ſin, and a Law accuſing and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but if we live by faith in Chriſt, and in the apprehenſion of his love, laying hold on the life, righteouſneſs, obedience, ſatisfaction of him whom the pirit cals ours, ſaying, Chriſt is ours and we are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods; and thus a believer
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:170103:220"/>
is bleſſed only in a righteouſneſs without, not with in; and all our aſſurance, confidence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are to flow in unto him, through a channel of faith, and not of works: by faith we ought to live above ſin, infirmities, temptations, deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſenſe, reaſon, fears, doubts; it makes the yoke of Chriſt eaſie and ſweet; it ſtates the ſoul in the poſſeſſion of heaven, whilſt the body remains on earth: by faith we can chee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fully part with, and ſuffer deprivation of the ſweeteſt outward comforts and enjoyments, and welcome death, knowing that we do but exchange the worſt place and things for better, the Lord Jeſus having ſpoken peace to the ſoul, that he hath paid all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his debts for it, and that his ſins ſhall be remembred no more; now the ſoul knows it is happy, and enjoys the comfort of it.</p>
                  <p>7. Make thy will in time of health, and leave all things clear upon both books, of ſhop and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that thou mayſt have nothing to do but to dye, and to meditate upon, and to have faith in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, which ſpeak of reſt, joy, peace, and perfect happineſs, which is provided for us in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, firmly believing that God will after this life give us all thoſe things with himſelf which he hath promiſed, as certainly as thou haſt in thy will gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thy relations ſuch and ſuch things for them to enjoy; and ſo exerciſe faith in the reſurrection of thy body, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 16. to have a ſpiritual body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 43, 44. to have a glorified body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. to have fulneſs of knowledge, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 18, 19. to have fulneſs of joy and pleaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch as ſhall be internal, pure, full, ſpiritual and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:170103:221"/>
eternal, where no miſery, hunger, cold, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pain, grief nor wearineſs, but reſt without labour; in reſt tranquility, in tranquility content, in contentment joy, in joy variety, in variety ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in ſecurity eternity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus ſhalt thou that haſt prepared for death aforehand, dye ſweetly, whilſt others that put off preparation to the laſt, O what a hurry be they in! Oh the anguiſh that their ſouls endure! they apprehending God angry with them, the Devil accuſing them, earth leaving them, heaven refuſing them, hell claiming them, ſoul and body par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, friends weeping, and themſelves hopeleſs, going they know not whither.</p>
                  <p>But to a godly man, death is neither ſtrange nor fearful unto him; not ſtrange, becauſe he dyed day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not fearful, becauſe whilſt he lived he was dead, and his life was hid with Chriſt in God; to dye then is nothing elſe, but to reſt from our labours, and to go home to our fathers houſe, unto the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the living God, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to an innumerable company of Angels, to the general aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, to God the Judge of all, and unto the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; whilſt his body is ſick, his mind is ſound, for God maketh all his bed in his ſickneſs, <hi>Pſal</hi> 41. 3. and as his outward man decayeth, the inward man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>renewed day by day, when the ſpeech of his tongue ſaltereth, the ſighs of his heart ſpeaks lowder unto God; when the ſight of the eyes faileth, the Holy Ghoſt illuminates him inwardly, with abundance of ſpiritual light: ſometimes he is ſaying with <hi>Paul, I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 1. 23.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:170103:221"/>
and with <hi>David, Pſalm 42. 2. As the heart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee O God, when ſhall come and appear before him? come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> So when the appointed time of his diſſolution is come, knowing that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his father and redeemer in the peace of a good conſcience, he ſaith, <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo ſurrenders up his ſoul, as it were with his own hands, into the hands of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, ſaying with <hi>David, Into thy hands, O Father I commend my ſoul, for thou haſt redeemed me O Lord, thou God of truth;</hi> and ſo ſaying with <hi>Stephen, Act. 7. 59. Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far of the preparation for death, with a taſte of the ſad condition of one dying out of Chriſt, and the ſweet condition of a Chriſtian dying, that is a member of Chriſt, that did prepare for death before it came. I had once intended here to have ſpoken to the ſad condition of the ungodly after death, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and laſt judgement, and alſo of the bleſſed condition of all that dye in the faith, after death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and laſt judgement, but that will not fallin order here; but towards the end of this book, when we come to ſpeak of the reſurrection of the body and laſt judgement, when Chriſt ſhall deliver up his Kingdom to his Father, and God ſhall be all in all. I ſhall proceed now to ſpeak of the ſecond coming of Chriſt in power and great glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

In a word, the ſecond coming of Chriſt might be farther proved by the immutability of Gods decree, and infallibility of his promiſes, and impartiality of his juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I meet with no ſort of people denying this truth, except a few of thoſe ſpoken of in the Goſpel, ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming? theſe people have renounced their reaſon, and made nonſenſe the mother of their devotion, &amp; therefore their arguments are not worth the anſwering: but the great difficulty lieth amongſt thoſe men that do believe a ſecond coming of Chriſt in power and great glory, and theſemen fall into theſe three ranks; the firſt ſaith that Chriſt ſhall come and reign perſonally on the earth a thouſand years before the laſt judgement; a ſecond ſort ſtands up, and ſaith, he ſhall not reign perſonally, but ſpiritually a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years in his Saints; a third ſort ſteps in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the two former, ſaying there is neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:170103:223"/>
reign, nor ſpiritual reign to be looked for at Chriſts next coming, for he comes to judge the world, and ſo to put an end to all things here below, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let the reader conſider, that it is with us now, a little before the ſecond coming of Chriſt, as it was with the Jews and others, a little before the firſt coming of Chriſt; for it is apparent they were in three diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as we now are, as appears by their darkneſs in theſe three portions of Scripture that ſpeaks of Chriſts firſt coming.</p>
               <p>One Scripture ſaid <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. thou <hi>Bethleem,</hi> out of thee ſhall come one to rule <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Scripture ſaid <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 9. 2, 6. the land of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthaly,</hi> the people which were in darkneſs have ſeen a great light, <hi>ver. 6. for unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A third Scripture, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. we read theſe words, out of Egypt have I called my Son, now in theſe three Scriptures the Prophets did ſeem to vary in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and the people after, about the coming of Chriſt in fleſh, differing as to the place where, or in which of theſe three Chriſt ſhould be born; this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of theirs begat this great queſtion in Court, <hi>Mat. 2. 4. Herod</hi> gathered together all the chief Prieſts and Scribes, and demanded of them where Chriſt ſhould be born, and they ſaid unto him, in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> &amp;c. Now the thing that I would have the reader to take ſpecial notice of, is this, that theſe three Scriptures were fulfilled at the coming of Chriſt, one after another, for he was born in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> called out of Egypt, and came to the land of <hi>Zebulon,</hi> and there preached, and the people that ſate in darkneſs ſaw a great light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why may
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:170103:224"/>
not all theſe three things fall in together, at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt in power, (to wit) a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal coming, a ſpiritual reign, and all the time of the reign, a judging of the world: let not us make thoſe things inconſiſtent, which may be conſiſtent, in a ſenſe, warily underſtood; this I am ſure, whilſt we are contending what Chriſt ſhall do when he comes, that we let ſlip our precious time, and not ſo prepare as we ought for his coming.</p>
               <p>Oh what a ſtate are things in, here every one tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his intereſt!

                  <p>BY Judgement is meant the pronouncing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of the irrevocable ſentence of abſolution or condemnation, in which the Godly ſhall be judged one way, and the wicked another way; for the firſt ſhall be Judged, but not condemned; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall be judged and condemned.</p>

                  <p>THE place where the Lord Chriſt ſhall ſit in Judgement, is verily thought to be in the air, over the Vally of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> by mount <hi>Olive,</hi> near to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Eaſtward from the temple, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 17. this might be confirmed by theſe reaſons.</p>

                  <p n="2">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe as Chriſt was there abouts crucified and put to open ſhame, ſo over that place his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous throne ſhall be erected, when he ſhall appear in judgement to judge the world in righteouſneſs, where he himſelf was unjuſtly judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>

                  <p>THE chief power of judicature ſhall be in Chriſt, for to him all power is given, and from whom no appeal can be made to any ſuperiour.

                  <p>VVE read in the Scripture that the time is a day; but there are three opinions among Chriſtians about this word day.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some take the day here ſpoken of preciſely and properly, as if the day of the laſt judgement ſhould not exceed that ſpace and proportion of time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some conceive that by the day is meant a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, becauſe ſome are ſaid to ſit on thrones, and have judgement given unto them, that is power of Judging, and to live and reign with Chriſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. but I conceive that this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reign of a thouſand years cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the laſt Judgement, becauſe death the laſt enemy ſhall in the reſurrection be deſtroyed; now after the end of the thouſand years mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Saint <hi>John,</hi> Satan ſhall be looſed out of the priſon, and the nations deceived by him, ſhall compaſs the camp of the Saints about, and the beloved City; and fire ſhall come down from God out of heaven and devour them all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others ſeem more ſafely to apprehend that the day here mentioned is to be taken improperly, for time indefinitely, it being in Scripture very ordinary to put a day for time: in an acceptable time have I heard thee, in a day of Salvation have I helped thee, <hi>Iſa. 49. 8. If thou hadſt known in this thy day, Luke 19. 42. Your Father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoyced to ſee my day, John 8. 56, &amp;c.</hi> there muſt be a day wherein that great work of judgement muſt begin, but the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof is to be meaſured by the nature of the

               <p>1. Their bodies ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Sun in the firmament, like the glorious body of Chriſt. The Glory of a thouſand Suns made into one, will be but as ſack-cloath to that wherein Chriſt ſhall appear in mans nature, he being in the Glory of his Father, <hi>Mat 16. 27. And we ſhall be like him. 1 John 3. 2. Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their father,</hi> as appears in this Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 43.</p>

In the ſlate of innocency, there was in man a poſſibility not to Sin, but in the ſtate of Glory there ſhall be no poſſibility to ſin. In a word, both body and ſoul in heaven, ſhall be in ſuch a bleſſed ſtate, that neither our tongue can expreſs it, nor our mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
               <p>The ſoul ſhall be more happy in being preſent with Jeſus Chriſt in heaven, then if it had been preſent with <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency. <hi>Adam</hi> was inſtated only in an earthly paradiſe; but now thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Chriſt, art inſtated in an everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; Again, <hi>Adam</hi> though pleaſed in a ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, yet he was liable to loſe that bleſſed ſlate, and did loſe it, though he were a perfect creature; but

by Chriſt we are inſtated in a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, or loſt.</p>
               <p>Again, When <hi>Adam</hi> was made by God in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he enjoyed only the ſociety of beaſts on the earth, and birds of the air; but when Chriſt brings a ſoul to heaven, God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints ſhall be his companions.</p>

Angles and Spirits of the juſt made perfect, do not ſpeak in their heavenly and ſpiritual manner, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating their minds one to anotheras they ſee cauſe, is againſt reaſon, and inconſiſting with the ſtate of bleſſedneſs; and to think they ſpeak in this manner, is not againſt Scripture or reaſon, though the full reſolution to this thing, <hi>viz.</hi> with what tongues the Angels and ſouls departed, ſpeak, ſeems to be reſerved till we come to heaven; ſome conceive we ſhall then all ſpeak in the Hebrew tongue.</p>
               <p>7. Let us conſider the variety of joyes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thoſe admirable good things which God hath prepared, and which Chriſt hath purchaſed for his ſervants; it is not for any wit of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or any tongue to relate, or any pen to ſet down: nevertheleſs let us ſet down a taſte of them as we find them revealed in Scriptures; in that life there ſhall be no earthly or ſinfull miſery, there ſhall be no ſin at all, no ſickneſs, no ſorrows, no diſeaſes nor malady, no croſs nor curſe, no vexation nor cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, no defect nor deformity, no tumults not troubles, no pain nor penury, all tears ſhall be done away, all evils removed, all ſin aboliſhed, all wants ſupplyed, <hi>Rev. 22. 3.

               <p>There ſhall be a perpetual poſſeſſion of all good things, even of God himſelf, who is goodneſs it ſelf; there ſhall be perfection of knowledge, no defect in love, certain ſecurity, coniſtant amity, and ſecure tranquility; the end why all this ſhall be given to us, is, that God may manifeſt his exceeding love to us, and that we might enjoy the full fruit of Chriſts death and paſſion; and laſtly, that we might acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

the wonderful mercies of God unto us, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate his name for ever; then ſhall we be in a ſtate of exemption from ſin, and from the cauſes of ſin, and from the puniſhment of ſin. The morall Philoſophers ſay, that hail, ſtorm and tempeſt are ingendred in the middle region, but above the middle region there is no wind, no ſtorm or tempeſt, but whilſt we are here below, ſet us expect ſtorms, winds, and blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering temptations: but when God takes us above this middle region, there is no ſtorm nor tempeſt to trouble us: then the Angels that rejoyced at our converſion, will much rejoyce together with us at our entrance into heaven</p>
               <p>8. Let us conſider the duration and continuance of this bleſſed ſtate, this life is an everlaſting life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 45. It ſhall continue world without end: life eternal is the higheſt degree of bleſſedneſs, in which we ſhall be made partakers of Chriſts glory, enjoying the ſight of God, and heavenly joyes for ever and ever, therefore it is termed everlaſting life, <hi>John</hi> 16. 22. and Chriſt faith that our joy ſhall no man take from us. Oh who can bear this and not admire it! Who can meditate on it, and not be amazed at it? as ſoon as any Saint in this life felt but a true taſte of theſe everlaſting joys, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted all the riches and pleaſures of this life to be but loſs and dung in reſpect of that, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with fervent prayers, faſtings, tears, faith, and good life, they gave all diligence, and laboured to aſcertain themſelves of this eternal life, and for the love thereof, they willingly parted with much of their earthly goods and poſſeſſions, to lay up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in heaven.</p>

               <head>What uſe we may make of all theſe precious things.</head>
               <p n="1">1. EXcellent arguments may be drawn to preſ-Chriſtians to a holy life, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 11. ſee ing then that all theſe things muſt be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs,</hi> and ver. 14. <hi>Wherefore ſeeing ye look for ſuch things, give diligence that ye may be found in him in peace;</hi> It is our duty to live in a continual expectation of the coming of the Lord Jeſus, with our loins girt, and our lamps burning; for bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his maſter when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider that here is a fountain opened for Chriſtian comfort, and ground for patience in all troubles, that there ſhall be an end: a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hope ſhall not be cut off: if in this life only we had hope, we were of all men moſt miſerable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. But here lyes the comfort and patience of true Chriſtians; theywait for another world, and they know it is a juſt thing with God to give them reſt after their labours, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9. and a crown after their combate, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. and after their long Pilgrimage, an everlaſting habitation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. Be patient, ſaith the Apoſtle, and ſettle your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, <hi>James 5. 8. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. When they that have ſown in tear ſhall reap in joy, <hi>Pſal</hi> 126. 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that aſſurance of that bleſſed ſtate may be attained in this life: we know, faith <hi>Paul,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:170103:247"/>
2 Cor. 5. 1.</hi> That if our earthly houſe of this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle be deſtroyed, we have a building, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens: theſe things, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> I have written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 13. I am ſure, ſaith <hi>Job 19. 25, 26, 27. that my Redeemer liveth, and he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin worms deſtroy this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh, whom I my ſelf ſhall ſee, and mine eyes ſhall behold:</hi> when I awake, ſaith <hi>David, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy Image, Pſal.</hi> 17. 15.</p>

Conſider that the cauſe of our ſalvation, and ſo of our glorious condition, is Gods meer love and favour, without any merit of ours, <hi>Luke 12. 32. It is our Fathers good pleaſure to give us a Kingdom,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 8. <hi>By grace we are ſaved through faith, and not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. everlaſting life is the gift of God; and though eternal life be called a reward, yet it is not of merit, but of mercy; let this be grounded in our hearts, that the Kingdom of heaven is not a ſtipend of ſervants, but an inheritance of Sons, which they only obtain, that lay hold on his mercy, <hi>Romans</hi> 5. 8. compared with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. and 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now as hath been ſaid, as the love of God is the cauſe of our ſalvation, fo Jeſus Chriſt is the way, <hi>Joh. 10. 9. Joh</hi> 14. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3, The holy Spirit is the guide in that way, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13.</p>

               <p n="5">5. The evidence of this ſalvation is faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
               <p>It is true, the inſtrumental cauſe, offering and proclaiming ſalvation is the Goſpel; but the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental receiving and applying it is faith, and the cauſe ſealing it inwardly to our ſouls, is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; the external and inſtrumental ſeals thereof are the two confirming Ordinances, Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The anchor of this ſalvation is hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19.</p>
